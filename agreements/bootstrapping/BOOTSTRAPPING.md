## EGC Quorum Establishment

Five projects are required for moving forward with binding commitments.
Each project must have an appointed EGC member to approve revised bylaws.

## Preliminary Commitment

By engaging in this agreement, projects indicate their preliminary, and non binding, intent to join the Commonhaus Foundation (CF), with the understanding that this stage does not involve any legal transfer of assets.
This intent is symbolized through a digital acknowledgment by the project's designated Extended Governance Committee (EGC) representative.
Where applicable, additional acknowledgments may be required to satisfy employer or vendor requirements, ensuring all parties are aligned with the project's commitment to the CF.

## Formation Period

Upon formal organization of the Commonhaus Foundation (CF), a designated Formation Period will commence, lasting one year.
This extended timeframe accommodates the collaborative development of essential operational processes, including but not limited to domain management, email domain assistance, and other logistical support necessary for the projects' success within the CF ecosystem.

During this period, projects are expected to:

- Adopt the [Code of Conduct][coc], as illustrated by [this project's CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md][coc-cf] and the corresponding [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md template][coc-tpl].
- Clearly document their current governance practices within their top-level project or repository[^1] for transparency. No changes to governance or operational practices is required. Refer to [this project's GOVERNANCE.md][gov-cf] and the [GOVERNANCE.md template][gov-tpl] for guidance.
- Engage in the development and refinement of CF's operational processes, ensuring all actions align with the [CF decision-making process][cc-dm].

[^1]: As an example, this could be in either the primary or `.github` repository within a GitHub organization.

## Binding Commitments Post-Formation

Projects are invited to enter into formal binding agreements at any stage during the Formation Period.
These agreements will encompass the transfer of project assets, such as trademarks and domains, formally integrating projects within the Commonhaus Foundation.

Should fewer than five projects commit their trademarks during or by the end of the Formation Period, the remaining projects retain the right to withdraw their membership without facing any penalties or obligations.

## Feedback and Iteration

To ensure the Commonhaus Foundation's (CF) governance and operational frameworks remain responsive and effective, regular feedback mechanisms will be established for the Extended Governance Committee (EGC).
These mechanisms include both convened sessions and asynchronous feedback via GitHub discussions, in accordance with the [electronic participation guidelines][cfc-async] and the [decision-making process][cc-dm] outlined in our bylaws.
This approach aims to address concerns, suggest operational improvements, and ensure ongoing alignment with the collective goals of the CF community, fostering a collaborative and flexible environment for governance and decision-making.
