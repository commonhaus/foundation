## Sponsorship Contribution

All contributions are made to Commonhaus Foundation, Inc., a Florida non-stock, nonprofit membership corporation operating as a tax-exempt entity under Section 501(c)(6) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code.
Contributions are *not* tax-deductible as charitable donations.

Each sponsorship payment determines your [tier benefits](./sponsorship-tiers.md) for one year.
The tier is assigned based on payment amount and applies for the full term.

All sponsorship payments are final and non-refundable.
If canceled early, benefits continue until term end without refunds or adjustments.
