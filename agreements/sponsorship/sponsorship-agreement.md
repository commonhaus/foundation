## Sponsorship Contribution

All contributions are made to Commonhaus Foundation, Inc., a Florida non-stock, nonprofit membership corporation operating as a tax-exempt entity under Section 501(c)(6) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code.
Contributions are *not* tax-deductible as charitable donations.

Each sponsorship payment provides a one (1) year term of benefits, including two (2) Advisory Board[^1] representatives and logo placement per sponsorship tier. The [tier](./sponsorship-tiers.md) is assigned based on the sponsorship amount at time of payment, and will apply for the full term.

All sponsorship payments are final and non-refundable. If a sponsor chooses to cancel before the end of the sponsorship term, benefits will continue until the end of the term, but no refunds or prorated adjustments will be issued.
