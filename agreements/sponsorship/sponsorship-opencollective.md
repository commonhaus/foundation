All contributions are made to Commonhaus Foundation, Inc., a Florida non-stock, nonprofit membership corporation operating as a tax-exempt entity under Section 501(c)(6) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code.
Contributions are *not* tax-deductible as charitable donations.

Sponsorship payments are facilitated directly through [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/commonhaus-foundation) and are **charged annually** based on the sponsor‚Äôs selected tier.
