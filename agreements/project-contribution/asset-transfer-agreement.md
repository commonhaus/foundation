This Asset Transfer Agreement ("Transfer Agreement") is made by and between Commonhaus Foundation ("Sponsor") and the Assignor(s) (“Assignor”) on behalf of the Project.

## Recitals

This Agreement governs the transfer of assets from the Assignor to the Sponsor in furtherance of the purposes and goals described in the [Fiscal Sponsorship Agreement][fs-landing].

The intangible assets associated with the Project, as described below, will be transferred to the Sponsor, and the Sponsor will assume responsibility for the Project’s operations.
After the transfer, the Assignor will no longer have any operational responsibility for the Project, except where other agreements apply (e.g., if the Assignor is also a Signatory of the Fiscal Sponsorship Agreement or continues to provide services to those Signatories).

Operational responsibilities, including the ongoing management and quality standards for these assets, are further outlined in the [Fiscal Sponsorship Agreement][fs-landing] and [Terms and Conditions][].

## Definitions

All capitalized terms used in this Transfer Agreement not defined in it are as defined in the [Fiscal Sponsorship Agreement][fs-landing].

**Assets**: The intangible assets specified in this agreement that are needed by Project to operate under the auspices of Sponsor without any disruption, alteration, or modification of the operations, processes, or activities.
The attached [schedules of assets](#schedules) identify the assets being transferred under this agreement; however, the schedules are not binding and the parties retain the right to amend the schedules as necessary.

**Contributor License Agreements**: Written agreements under which the Assignor has received licenses or assignments from contributors that allow for reproduction, modification, distribution, or ownership of third-party contributions to the Software.

**Copyrights**: The copyrights owned by Assignor for the Software, including registrations, applications, renewals, and all related past and future infringement claims.

**Domain Names**: The internet domain names used by the Project.

**Hosting Accounts**: The accounts used by the Project for hosting of its software and related operations, such as web hosting accounts, document hosting platforms, build and testing servers, and cloud infrastructure.

**Social Media and Email Accounts**: The social media and email accounts used by the Project, excluding Hosting Accounts.

**Software**:  The computer programs associated with the Project, and their documentation, over which the Assignor exercises control through hosting or acting as maintainer.

**Source Code Repositories**: The repository accounts (such as GitHub organizations, repositories, or bots) used by the Project to maintain its software, documentation, and related materials, and currently controlled by the Assignor as host or maintainer. For the avoidance of doubt, this does not include any code or other content maintained in the repositories.

**Trademarks**: The trademarks, service marks, logos, trade dress and trade names, registered or unregistered, used by the Project, including the associated goodwill and all past and future infringement claims related to them.

## Transfer of Assets

Assignor hereby transfers to the Sponsor all rights, title, and interest in and to the Assets identified in the schedules below, including any intellectual property rights in those Assets that are owned by Assignor.

Assignor shall provide all necessary credentials and assist as needed in the transfer of the Assets to the Sponsor.

After the transfer of Assets, operational responsibilities related to those Assets will be delegated to the Project Signatories, consistent with the Fiscal Sponsorship Agreement and Terms and Conditions.

Assignor agrees to execute any additional documents, such as Exhibit A for registered Trademarks, and perform any further acts that Sponsor may reasonably request to effectuate the purposes of this Transfer Agreement and to fully establish and secure Assignee's rights in the Assets.

Assignor hereby grants Sponsor a limited power of attorney, coupled with an interest, to sign, on Assignor's behalf, any additional documents that Assignor may need in order to record the assignment of the Assets with government offices.
Sponsor will only do so if Assignor does not sign the documents within a reasonable period of time after Sponsor's request.

### Applicable Asset Categories
