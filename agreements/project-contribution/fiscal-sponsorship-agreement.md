This Fiscal Sponsorship Agreement ("Agreement") is made by and between Commonhaus Foundation ("Sponsor") and the Project Signatories ("Signatories") on behalf of the Project.
This Agreement incorporates by reference the [Terms and Conditions][] for Fiscal Sponsorship ("Terms").

## Recitals

Sponsor’s mission is to foster a diverse community to collaboratively create, maintain, and evolve open source libraries, tools, and frameworks to ensure their long-term growth and stability.

The purpose of the Project (the "Project Purposes") is to produce, distribute, document, and improve software and/or documentation published under an Open Source Initiative (OSI) approved license, and to facilitate and organize its production, improvement and ease of use.

Sponsor’s governing body (the "Council") has determined that acting as the Project’s fiscal sponsor by receiving assets and incurring liabilities identified for the Project Purposes and using them to pursue the Project Purposes will further the mission of the Sponsor and the common business interests of its members.

The Council has approved the creation of a restricted fund to support the Project’s purposes, as detailed in the [Restricted Fund](#restricted-fund-and-variance-power) section.

The Sponsor is a Florida nonprofit corporation exempt from federal income tax under Section 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC").

The individuals listed as Signatories desire to manage the Project on behalf of the Sponsor, subject to the Sponsor’s [discretion and control](#collaborative-management).
Future project leaders, upon assuming leadership roles, shall be required to acknowledge and agree to the terms of this agreement as a condition of their role. Records of the current Signatories will be jointly maintained alongside asset inventories as defined in the [Terms and Conditions][].

## Agreement

For purposes of this Agreement, the term “Project” refers to the coordinated activities and associated assets aimed at achieving the Project Purposes, under the stewardship of the Signatories.

On the Effective Date, the Sponsor shall assume responsibility for the Project as described in the [Collaborative Management](#collaborative-management) section.
This arrangement shall remain in effect unless and until terminated as provided under the [Termination](#termination) section of this Agreement.

**The Project is not a separate legal entity and is not an agent of the Sponsor.**
The Signatories acknowledge that they and the Project do not, and shall not, act as an agent for the Sponsor unless specifically authorized in writing.

The Signatories shall abide by the [Terms and Conditions][], which the Sponsor may amend as described in those Terms.

### Project Management and Activities

From the Effective Date, the following activities shall be conducted in the name of the Sponsor, under its oversight and guidance, as provided in the [Collaborative Management](#collaborative-management) section of this Agreement and in accordance with the Sponsor's [Terms and Conditions][]:

- Community programs
- Public information work
- Fundraising events
- Processing and acknowledgment of cash and non-cash revenue items
- Accounts payable and receivable
- Negotiation of leases and contracts
- Disbursement of Project funds (including grants)
- Other activities conducted in furtherance of the Project

### Independent Activities

Individuals and organizations working on the Project are permitted to engage in independent activities to promote and support the Project, including:

- Hosting and participating in community events related to the Project
- Promoting the Project at various events and through different channels

These independent activities do not require prior approval from the Sponsor.
However, the financial management and legal compliance of independently raised funds rest solely with the individuals or groups managing those funds.
They must ensure that appropriate financial mechanisms are followed and that these activities do not conflict with the Sponsor's policies or jeopardize its tax-exempt status.

### Periodic Review

The Sponsor may periodically review the Project, as outlined in the [Terms and Conditions][] and this Agreement, to ensure compliance with applicable laws, policies, and quality standards associated with Sponsor-managed assets.

### Assets and Property

All tangible and intangible property, including but not limited to copyrights, domain names, social media accounts, email addresses, trademarks, and intellectual property created with Project funds or acquired by the Project, shall be held by the Sponsor for the exclusive benefit of the Project’s purposes.

The Sponsor retains sole ownership of all trademarks, service marks, logos, and other brand elements (collectively, “Marks”) associated with the Project.
All goodwill generated through the use of these Marks inures solely to the benefit of the Sponsor.
The Signatories acknowledge and agree that their use of the Marks does not confer any ownership rights in the Marks to the Signatories or any individuals or entities associated with the Project.

The transfer of assets associated with the Project may involve one or more [Asset Transfer Agreements][fs-landing], depending on the scope and nature of the resources being transferred.
Each agreement will specify the terms and inventory of assets to ensure a comprehensive and organized transition.
Ongoing updates to asset inventories will be managed as described in the [Terms and Conditions][].

### Collaborative Management

The Sponsor and Signatories will collaborate to manage the Project’s day-to-day operations, ensuring alignment with the Sponsor’s quality standards, mission, and the Project’s purposes.

**Project Representative:** Signatories will nominate a representative for the Project to the Extended Governance Committee (EGC).
This representative will be the primary contact with the Sponsor for the Project, and the Sponsor may rely on information and instructions provided by the Project representative.

**Management Authority:**
Beginning on the Effective Date, the Signatories will assume responsibility for the ongoing development and maintenance of Project materials, software, and related services, acting on behalf of the Sponsor and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Sponsor’s policies.
The Sponsor retains ultimate oversight and authority, along with necessary administrative access, to ensure continuity and alignment with the Sponsor’s mission and quality standards as described in the [Terms and Conditions][].

The Signatories agree to uphold the quality of the Project’s offerings, ensuring that all goods, services, and representations associated with the Project and bearing the Marks meet the Sponsor’s standards.
In the event that quality issues arise which could impact the goodwill associated with the Marks, the Sponsor may provide guidance.
The Signatories agree to promptly implement such guidance to maintain consistency with the Sponsor’s quality expectations.

### Fundraising and Financial Management

**Sponsor-Managed Funds:**
The Sponsor will take ownership of the Project’s assets as defined in the [Assets and Property](#assets-and-property) section and manage funds on behalf of the Project in compliance with its tax-exempt status (501(c)(6)).
All funds managed by the Sponsor will be handled according to the Sponsor’s financial policies and procedures to ensure compliance with tax laws.
The Sponsor shall be permitted to debit (or withhold) administrative fees from the Project’s [restricted fund](#restricted-fund-and-variance-power) an amount equal to the administrative fees, interest, and charges for any extra services as specified in the [Terms and Conditions][] and Policies then in effect, and credit to the Sponsor’s general fund.
Such fees, interest, and charges are necessary to compensate the Sponsor for its services in administering the Project and thus become unrestricted rather than restricted assets when credited to the Sponsor’s general fund.

**Fundraising Activities:**
The Project may solicit gifts, contributions, and grants to the Sponsor identified as made in support of the Project Purposes.
The Project will provide information and the text of the Project’s fundraising materials for the Sponsor’s review in advance of the use and distribution of these materials.
The Signatories agree to make changes to fundraising materials as the Sponsor determines are necessary to ensure compliance with applicable laws.

**Fundraising Independence:**
Individuals and organizations working on the Project may independently raise funds and compensate contributors, provided such activities comply with applicable laws and do not conflict with this Agreement or the Sponsor’s policies.

To avoid confusion, independent financial activities must be clearly distinguished from those managed by the Sponsor.
Public communications about such activities must include disclaimers clarifying that these funds are not part of the fiscal sponsorship arrangement and are managed solely by the responsible individuals or organizations.

The Sponsor bears no responsibility for the financial management or legal compliance of independently raised funds.
Those managing such funds must ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.

**Transparency and Coordination:**
While external fundraising and financial management are permitted, Signatories are encouraged to maintain transparency and coordinate with the Sponsor to ensure alignment with the Sponsor’s mission and the Project’s goals and purposes.
This includes providing relevant updates on independent activities that may affect the Project’s reputation, deliverables, or relationship with the Sponsor.

### Restricted Fund and Variance Power

Beginning on the Effective Date, all monetary contributions to the Project will be placed in a restricted fund, used solely for the Project Purposes.

**Expenditure Authority:**
While the Sponsor will delegate certain expenditure authority to the Signatories as provided in this Agreement and the [Terms and Conditions][], the Sponsor retains the unilateral right to spend such funds to accomplish the Project Purposes as nearly as possible[^1] within the Sponsor’s sole judgment, subject to any more specific donor-imposed restrictions on the use of such assets.

[^1]: This provision is meant to ensure that if it is no longer feasible for the funds to be spent for the Project Purposes (for example if a sponsored project ceases to operate), CF can use the funds for other projects without seeking approval of a court.

- The restricted fund must be used in alignment with donor intent and for tax-exempt purposes.

- Neither party shall spend or otherwise obligate the Sponsor to pay for an amount or amounts exceeding the balance in the restricted fund, nor shall either party authorize or permit anyone to do so.

- The parties agree that all money and the fair market value of all property in the restricted fund be reported as the income of the Sponsor on the Sponsor’s financial statements and tax returns.

It is the intent of the parties that this Agreement should be interpreted to provide the Sponsor with variance powers necessary to enable the Sponsor to treat the restricted fund as the Sponsor’s asset in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) paragraphs ASC 958-605-25-25 and -26, formerly expressed in [Statement No. 136][136] issued by the [Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)][fasb].

### Performance of Exempt Purposes

Because the Sponsor is subject to the complex legal and tax rules applicable to IRC Section 501(c)(6) trade associations and the Project is an operation of the Sponsor, all of the assets received by the Sponsor under the terms of this Agreement shall be devoted to the Project Purposes, within the tax-exempt purposes of the Sponsor.

- No change to the Project Purposes may be made without the prior written approval of the Sponsor.

- Expenditures for any attempt to influence legislation or advocate for or against any candidate for political office within the meaning of IRC Section 501(c)(6) shall be subject to limitations imposed by the Sponsor.

- The Sponsor will not use, and will not permit the use of, any portion of the assets to cause any private inurement to occur[^2], nor to take any other action inconsistent with IRC Section 501(c)(6).

[^2]: "Private inurement" means an inappropriate financial benefit to an insider, such as a board member, officer, or member, as addressed in more detail in the [Conflict of Interest Policy][].

### Termination

Either party may terminate this Agreement, based upon a material breach of this Agreement by the other party, by giving ten (10) days’ written notice to the other party.

This Agreement may be terminated by the Sponsor upon thirty (30) days’ written notice if:

1. The Sponsor determines that the objectives of the Project can no longer reasonably be accomplished by the Sponsor;

2. The Sponsor determines in its reasonable discretion that continued sponsorship of the Project is inconsistent with the Sponsor’s charitable purposes or tax-exempt status; or

3. The Sponsor determines in its reasonable discretion that another organization would better serve the Project’s charitable purposes as a fiscal sponsor.

This Agreement may be terminated, with or without cause, by the Signatories at any time upon thirty (30) days’ written notice to the Sponsor.

If Project leaders are found to be in violation of the law with respect to Project-related activities, the Sponsor retains the right to terminate this Agreement immediately and take necessary actions to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.

#### Effect of Termination

Upon termination of this Agreement, the Sponsor and Signatories shall work together in good faith to dispose of any Project assets and liabilities as follows:

- The *notice period* may be extended by mutual agreement of the parties, provided that the Sponsor will not unreasonably withhold its approval of an extension.

- During the notice period:
    - The Signatories will identify another organization (including an organization that was formed by the Signatories for this purpose) that is tax-exempt under IRC Section 501(c)(6) or 501(c)(3) (a "Successor") and is willing and able to sponsor the Project.
        - "Able" means that transition of the Project to the Successor is consistent with the common business interests of the Sponsor’s members and the Successor has the financial and administrative capacity to manage the Project competently.
        - Before being eligible to succeed to the role of sponsor of the Project, the Successor shall be subject to the approval of the Sponsor, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

- Once the parties agree on a Successor, the balance of assets in the Sponsor’s restricted fund for the Project, together with any other tangible and intangible assets held and liabilities incurred by the Sponsor in connection with the Project, shall be transferred to the Successor at the end of the notice period or any mutually agreed upon extension thereof, subject to the approval of any third parties that may be required.

- If no Successor acceptable to both parties is found by the end of the notice period or any mutually agreed upon extension thereof, or if the Project was terminated by the Sponsor as a result of a material breach of this Agreement by the Signatories, the Sponsor may dispose of the Project assets and liabilities in any manner consistent with applicable tax and charitable trust laws.

- Administrative fees deducted by the Sponsor under [Fundraising and Financial Management](#fundraising-and-financial-management) shall not be refundable upon termination, or under any other circumstances.

### Conflict Resolution

In the event of a dispute between the Project and the Sponsor, both parties agree to make a good faith effort to reconcile their differences through direct negotiation.

If resolution cannot be reached through negotiation within thirty (30) days, the parties may submit the dispute to mediation by a mutually agreed upon mediator.

Should mediation fail, the Project shall have the option of terminating this Agreement and finding a Successor as outlined in [Effect of Termination](#effect-of-termination).

If the Project is unable to find a Successor, the Sponsor may dispose of the Project’s assets and liabilities in any manner consistent with applicable tax and charitable trust laws.

In the event of any controversy, claim, or dispute between the parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement or its alleged breach, the prevailing party shall, in addition to any other relief, be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs of sustaining its position.

### Limitation of Liability

In no event shall either party be liable to the other party or to any third party for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or exemplary damages arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, whether or not the party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

This limitation of liability shall not apply to any liability resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of a party.

### Severability

Each provision of this Agreement shall be separately enforceable, and the invalidity of one provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision.

### Governing Law

This Agreement shall be interpreted and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida applicable to contracts to be performed entirely within such State.
Timeliness is critical for this Agreement and all its provisions.

### No Waiver

If the Sponsor does not exercise its rights under this Agreement, it does not mean those rights are waived.

### Entire Agreement and Amendments

This Agreement, including the incorporated [Terms and Conditions][], constitutes the complete agreement among the parties, superseding all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, regarding its subject matter.

- In the event of a conflict between this Agreement and the Terms and Conditions, the terms of this Agreement shall prevail.
- Amendments to this Agreement (excluding the Terms and Conditions) must be in a written document signed by all parties.
- The Sponsor may amend the [Terms and Conditions][] as outlined within those Terms.
