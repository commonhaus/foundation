To all concerned,

On behalf of the “[Project Name]” project, I’m requesting an amendment to the Fiscal Sponsorship Agreement originally signed on `[Original Agreement Date]`.

This amendment reflects the following changes:

1. `[e.g. Add New Signatory – Name, Email]`  
2. `[e.g. Remove Signatory – Name, Email]`  

Where applicable, the new Signatory has confirmed their agreement to be bound by the Fiscal Sponsorship Agreement and the Terms and Conditions.  
If a Signatory is resigning, they have confirmed in writing that they have completed required transition steps as outlined in the Terms and Conditions.

Please reply to this message to confirm. Once all required parties have replied affirmatively, this thread will serve as a written amendment to the Agreement.

Thanks,  
`[Name]`  
Project Representative / Signatory  
`[Email]`  
`[Date]`
