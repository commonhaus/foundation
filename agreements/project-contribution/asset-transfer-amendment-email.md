# Email Template for Amendment to Asset Transfer Agreement

This email format can be used by a Project Representative or Signatory to request a change to the Asset Transfer Agreement.

An amendment is valid if:

- All required parties are included on the thread (e.g. Commonhaus, the Assignor)
- The email clearly states what is being amended
- Each party replies affirmatively to confirm

Notes:

- `project-[project-name]@commonhaus.org` is the shared group email provided by Commonhaus for communication with project signatories.
- The `To` field should include any party from whom confirmation is required (e.g. Assignor, Commonhaus Legal).
- When listing additional assets, use the [same format as the original schedule](./asset-transfer-agreement.md#amendments).
