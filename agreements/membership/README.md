# Membership agreements

These agreements will be rendered and recorded as part of the membership application and renewal process. They are designed to ensure that members understand and agree to the terms and conditions of membership in the Commonhaus Foundation (CF).

Affirmed responses will not be stored in this repository, but will be recorded in the Commonhaus Foundation's membership database.
