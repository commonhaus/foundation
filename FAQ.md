# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

## Why create a new foundation?

There are already several foundations which host open source projects,
and each has its own focus and requirements.
The CF is a home for self-governing, code-centric open source projects.
Each open source project has its own unique needs and goals,
and not every foundation is the right fit for every project.

There are many critical application frameworks and libraries within the open source ecosystem that are not currently part of a foundation.
The CF is a new option for projects to consider when looking for a foundation to call home,
helping to strengthen the open source ecosystem as a whole by ensuring more projects are sustainable in the long term.

Information covering benefits of the CF are in the [README](README.md):

- [Core Distinctions of the CF](README.md#core-distinctions-of-cf)
- [CF Guiding Principles](README.md#our-guiding-principles)
- [Focus and Vision](README.md#cfs-focus-and-vision)
- [Community and Sponsorship](README.md#community-and-sponsorship)

## Why not the Apache Software Foundation?

The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) has a long standing tradition of being a home for open source projects of all types,
and continues to be a great home for many.
As part of a project joining the ASF, it is required to run on the infrastructure that is provided for projects, including mailing lists,
and adhere to its processes.

For projects with well established infrastructure and processes, it's preferable for these to remain unchanged when joining a foundation.
Though the CF provides default processes for projects joining the foundation,
they're not mandatory when projects already have processes in place which achieve the same outcomes.

All projects at the ASF must be licensed under a version of the Apache Software License (ASL).
At the CF, we provide projects a choice of several OSI approved licenses for their project.

## Why not the Eclipse Foundation?

The Eclipse Foundation (EF) has been around almost as long as the ASF, and is home to many open source projects as well.
In addition to open source projects, the EF oversees specification projects, particularly in relation to JakartaEE.
A key requirement for projects joining the EF is naming a project with the prefix _Eclipse_,
to reinforce brand recognition.

At the CF we strive to increase the brand of the project foremost, and the foundation secondarily.
The CF does not require project name changes when joining.

Open source projects at the CF may implement standards or specifications defined by other organizations,
such as the EF, but the CF will not oversee projects developing standards or specifications.
That is not where the CF will focus its efforts.

## Why not the Linux Foundation?

The Linux Foundation (LF) has many open source projects, including the Linux kernel itself.
Though the LF is a _neutral home_ for open source projects,
any project joining the LF is a very small part of a much larger organization.
So much so, the LF itself consists of other foundations,
such as the OpenJS Foundation, the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), and LF Networking.

The CF strives to take a more focused approach to open source projects,
housing projects with a shared/common interest around a domain.
