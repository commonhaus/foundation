### For Individuals: Become a Member

Commonhaus is built by and for the people who care about open source — maintainers, contributors, documentarians, organizers, and advocates.

We aim to remain a community-driven foundation, not one shaped solely by corporate interests.
That’s why individual participation isn’t just welcome — it’s essential.

**How to Join**

Start by sponsoring the foundation via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/commonhaus) or [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/commonhaus-foundation/donate).
Sponsors gain access to a self-service member page where you can view your status and complete the membership application.

As a member, you can:

- Vote in Foundation elections and hold offices
- Help shape strategic direction and governance
- Show your support with a `@commonhaus.dev` email address

Your support, voice, and vote help keep Commonhaus accountable to the people it’s here to serve.

### For Companies & Organizations: Become a sponsor

We’re looking to grow our base of corporate sponsors — companies and vendors who rely on our projects or believe in open source and want to invest in its sustainability.

Your support helps us provide essential services to our projects, and it also funds contributors who elevate their work — including writers, designers, and community coordinators.

Gold and Silver sponsors receive seats on our Advisory Board, creating a space for collaboration and shared perspective. It’s a meaningful way to align your organization’s values with the long-term health of the open source projects you depend on.

[Become a Sponsor](./agreements/sponsorship/README.md) and help fund the day-to-day work that keeps our projects thriving.
