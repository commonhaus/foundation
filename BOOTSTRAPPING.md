# Bootstrapping the Commonhaus Foundation

This document outlines the interim procedures and commitments during the foundation's initial establishment phase. It provides guidelines for project commitments, ensuring mutual trust and flexibility until the foundation reaches a stable state.

## 1. Preliminary Commitments

Projects express a non-binding intent to join the Commonhaus Foundation (CF).
No legal transfers of trademarks, domains, or other assets are required during this phase.

## 2. Quorum Establishment

A minimum number (or "quorum") of projects is established as a requirement for moving forward with binding commitments. This ensures that no project is committing without sufficient collaborative support.

If the quorum is not met within a stipulated timeframe, projects have the option to reconsider their participation.

## 3. Formation Period

After the foundation is formally organized, there is a *Formation Period* during which projects can assess the viability and effectiveness of the collaborative effort, and actively work towards building and establishing the foundation's structures and processes.

During this time, projects can monitor participation levels and foundational processes.

- The initial [CF Council][cfc] (CFC) will contain representatives from all participating projects.
- Decisions should follow (and refine) the [CF decision making process][cc-dm].

## 4. Trademark Donations and Other Commitments

Only after the Formation Period, and provided that the established quorum continues to support the foundation, will projects be required to make binding commitments like donating trademarks.

If fewer than the quorum decide to commit their trademarks after the Formation Period, the remaining projects have the right to withdraw their membership without any penalties or obligations.

## 5. Feedback and Iteration

During the bootstrapping process, regular feedback sessions should be held. 
These sessions provide an opportunity for projects to voice concerns, suggest changes, and ensure the foundation's direction aligns with collective goals.
