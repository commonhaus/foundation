# [Project Name] Security Policy

This document explains how to report security issues for **[Project Name]**.

<!-- Using this template

## Minimal Option

If this project follows the Commonhaus Foundation’s organization-wide policy directly, you may simply state:

> This project follows the [Commonhaus Foundation Security Policy][SEC].

[SEC]: https://github.com/commonhaus/.github/blob/main/SECURITY.md

## Custom Project Policy

If the project has its own security process, please provide details here.

## Example policy

Set realistic expectations for how your project will handle security issues and incidents. 

What follows is an example. Inspiration for this example comes from [Libxml2's "no security embargoes" policy (LWN)](https://lwn.net/Articles/1025971/).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report suspected security issues privately.

- **Preferred:** Use GitHub’s “Report a vulnerability” link in the repository sidebar.
- **Alternative:** Email **[maintainer email or security contact]**.
- Do **not** open a public issue for suspected vulnerabilities.

When reporting, please include:

- A description of the issue and affected versions
- Steps to reproduce (ideally a minimal proof-of-concept)
- Assessment of potential impact
- Your contact information
- Any specific requests, such as anonymity for you and/or the organization you represent

## Maintainer Commitments

We aim to handle reports quickly and responsibly.

- Our goal is to acknowledge reports as soon as possible.
- We will provide an initial assessment as capacity allows.
- Progress updates will be shared until resolution.
- Disclosure will be coordinated with the reporter, and credit given unless anonymity is requested.

## Disclosure and Embargoes

By default, **[Project Name]** does **not** accept long embargoes.
Security reports will usually become public once a fix is available and confirmed.
A short embargo may be considered in exceptional cases (e.g., downstream user protection), but is not guaranteed.

## Expectations for Reporters

Reporters should understand that:

- This project's security reports are handled by **[volunteers / sponsored contributors / commercial entity]**.
- Reports with clear steps, proof-of-concept, or test cases help us respond faster.
- Respecting maintainer capacity and workload benefits the community overall.

## Scope and Versions

This policy applies to the **[Project Name]** codebase and related artifacts.
We currently support security fixes for:

- **[Latest release line / active LTS versions / specify policy]**

Older versions may not receive patches; in such cases we may advise upgrading.

## Transparency

We may document known security issues or our response status when appropriate.
This helps users understand our process and sets realistic expectations.
