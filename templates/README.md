# Commonhaus Templates

We don't want project on-boarding to be a burden.

The files in this folder are our recommendations for what CF projects should define.

- [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- [Governance](GOVERNANCE.md)

## Other files

- If you use a DCO, your project should have a **DCO.txt** (case-insensitive) file containing content from <http://developercertificate.org/>

- **CONTRIBUTING.md** to explain how to make successful contributions (be real).

    - If your project uses a DCO, include that in your contribution guide. [For example](https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-orm/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#legal):

        ```md
        All contributions are subject to the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](http://developercertificate.org/).
        The DCO text is also included verbatim in the [dco.txt](./dco.txt) file in the root directory of this repository.
        ```

    - If your project uses a CLA, include that requirement in the contribution guide. [For example](https://github.com/jreleaser/jreleaser/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.adoc#contributor-license-agreement):

        ```md
        Contributor License Agreement

        Contributions to JReleaser are protected by a CLA.
        Please read the document before making a contribution.
        Youâ€™ll be asked to digitally sign the document on your first contribution.
        Feel free to open a discussion topic if you have questions.
        ```

- **CODEOWNERS** to define individuals or teams that are responsible for code in a repository
