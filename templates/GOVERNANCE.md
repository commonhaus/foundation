1. **Consensus-seeking (lazy consensus):** The project primarily aims for a consensus-based decision-making process, where maintainers and active contributors discuss and come to an agreement. 
2. **Voting:** In situations where consensus cannot be reached, decisions may be made through a simple majority vote among the maintainers.
3. **Conflict Resolution:** If conflicts arise, maintainers are responsible for facilitating a resolution. The [Commonhaus Council][cc] can be asked to mediate the discussion, if necessary.
