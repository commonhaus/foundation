# CONTRIBUTING to the Commonhaus Foundation Repository

Hey there, contributor! First off, thank you for considering a contribution to the Commonhaus Foundation (CF) repository.
We appreciate your effort and your desire to make this a better resource for everyone.
While there might not be traditional code here, we treat our documents with the same rigor and attention to detail.

## Getting Started

### 1. Consider Opening an Issue (Optional for Minor Changes)

While opening an issue is generally recommended for tracking and discussing proposed changes, it's not always required, especially for trivial modifications.

- For smaller changes or straightforward fixes, you can directly initiate a pull request (PR) where discussions can also take place.
- For more significant updates or enhancements, opening an issue helps in organizing and deliberating the changes with the community and relevant teams.

### 2. Fork the Repository

Fork the repository to your own GitHub account.
This will allow you to work on your proposed changes independently before submitting them for review.

## Making Changes

### 1. Be Clear and Concise

Our documents aim to be direct and developer-friendly.
We value clarity, so please ensure your changes or additions reflect that.

### 2. Adhere to the Format

Please maintain the structure and format of the documents you're amending. Consistency makes it easier for everyone.

### 3. Reference Issues

In your commit messages, reference the issue number you're addressing. For instance:

```bash
git commit -m "Fixed typo in section X, resolves #123"
```

## Submitting Changes

### 1. Create a Pull Request (PR)

Once you're ready to submit your changes, create a new pull request from your fork.
Ensure the PR description is clear about the changes you've made.

### 2. Await Review

One of the `CODEOWNERS` will review your PR.
We might request further clarifications, changes, or provide feedback.

### 3. Address Feedback

If feedback is provided on your PR, please address it in a timely manner.
Once all feedback has been addressed, and the PR is approved, it will be merged into the main repository.

## A Note on Legal Matters

Given the nature of this repository, some changes or amendments might require legal review.
We appreciate your patience as we ensure that all content aligns with the foundation's principles and legal considerations.

## Thank You

Every contribution, be it small or large, helps us maintain and improve this repository.
Your willingness to help is genuinely appreciated.

For any questions or further information, don't hesitate to reach out to us.

Happy contributing!
