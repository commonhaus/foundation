# CONTRIBUTING to the Commonhaus Foundation Repository

Hey there, contributor! First off, thank you for considering a contribution to the Commonhaus Foundation (CF) repository.
We appreciate your effort and your desire to make this a better resource for everyone.
While there might not be traditional code here, we treat our documents with the same rigor and attention to detail.

## Getting Started

### 1. Open an Issue

Before making any changes, open an issue in the repository. This helps us track and discuss the proposed changes, be it a typo, an enhancement, or a substantial amendment. Describe your issue in detail, and tag any relevant maintainers or teams.

### 2. Fork the Repository

Fork the repository to your own GitHub account. This will allow you to work on your proposed changes independently before submitting them for review.

## Making Changes

### 1. Be Clear and Concise

Our documents aim to be direct and developer-friendly. We value clarity, so please ensure your changes or additions reflect that.

### 2. Adhere to the Format

Please maintain the structure and format of the documents you're amending. Consistency makes it easier for everyone.

### 3. Reference Issues

In your commit messages, reference the issue number you're addressing. For instance:

```bash
git commit -m "Fixed typo in section X, resolves #123"
```

## Submitting Changes

### 1. Create a Pull Request (PR)

Once you're ready to submit your changes, create a new pull request from your fork. Ensure the PR description is clear about the changes you've made.

### 2. Await Review

The Commonhaus Foundation Council (CFC) and, when necessary, Foundation-retained legal counsel will review your PR.
We might request further clarifications, changes, or provide feedback.

### 3. Address Feedback

If feedback is provided on your PR, please address it in a timely manner. 
Once all feedback has been addressed, and the PR is approved, it will be merged into the main repository.

## A Note on Legal Matters

Given the nature of this repository, some changes or amendments might require legal review. 
We appreciate your patience as we ensure that all content aligns with the foundation's principles and legal considerations.

## Thank You!

Every contribution, be it small or large, helps us maintain and improve this repository. 
Your willingness to help is genuinely appreciated.

For any questions or further information, don't hesitate to reach out to us. Happy contributing!
