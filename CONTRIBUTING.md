# CONTRIBUTING to the Commonhaus Foundation Repository

Thanks for considering a contribution to the Commonhaus Foundation (CF) repository. We value every contribution, whether it's a document edit or a major revision.

## Quick Start

- **Discuss First**: For significant changes, start a GitHub discussion to gather consensus[^1]. For smaller edits, you can directly create a pull request (PR).

- **Fork and Edit**: Fork the repository to your account, make your changes there.

## Making Changes

- **Be Clear**: Ensure your contributions are direct and easy to understand.
- **Remain Consistent**: Follow the existing format and structure of the documents.
- **Cross-reference Discussions and PRs**: Link back to relevant discussions or other PRs in your commit messages.
- **Building documents (optional)**: When you create a PR, a build will run that will verify internal and external links, and will generate and attach pdfs to the build.
  - **Verify links**: To validate links locally, use `npm ci` to install node dependencies; `npm run test` or `npm run tv` to validate links.
  - **Build pdfs**: If you use docker or podman, run `./.github/docker-build-pdf.sh` to use a pre-configured docker image to convert markdown bylaws and policies to pdf.

## Submitting Changes

- **Create a PR**: Submit your changes via a pull request from your fork. Check the automatic build for link or pdf generation errors.
- **Wait for Review**: A code owner will review your PR and might ask for changes or clarifications.
- **Respond to Feedback**: Address any feedback to get your PR approved and merged.

## Legal Review

Some changes may need a legal review. Your patience is appreciated during this process.

## Thank You

Every contribution matters. For any questions, feel free to reach out.

Happy contributing!
