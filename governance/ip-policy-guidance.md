# Commonhaus Foundation IP Policy Guidance

This guide simplifies the [Commonhaus Foundation (CF) IP Policy][IP Policy] for easier implementation.

[IP Policy]: https://ip-policy.website
[cc]: ../GOVERNANCE.md#commonhaus-council "Commonhaus Foundation Council"
[standard website footer]: website-footers.md "Commonhaus Foundation website footers"

## Basic IP Requirements

1. **Licensing:** Refer to the [IP Policy][] for approved licenses. If your chosen license isn't listed, [seek an exemption](#obtaining-an-exemption).

2. **Copyright Notices:** 
    We recommend one of the following:

   - Copyright &lt;year of file creation> The XYZ Authors.
   - Copyright &lt;year of file creation> Contributors to the XYZ project.
   - Copyright &lt;year of file creation> The original author or authors.

    Do not alter existing copyright lines unless you have the right to do so. Updating the year after the file is created is unnecessary.
    
    Additional reading on [copyright statements in your code][code-copyright].
    
3. **Website Footer:** Ensure your project's website has the [standard website footer][].

4. **Contribution Licensing:** Projects can use either the [DCO][] or a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) for contributions. The chosen method should align with the project's governance and community preferences.

## Obtaining an Exemption

If the [IP Policy][] doesn't cater to your project's needs, request special permission from the [CF Council (CFC)][cc].

[Steps to request an exemption TBD]
