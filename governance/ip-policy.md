The Commonhaus Foundation (CF) oversees multiple individual projects, referred to as “Projects”. Contributions to these Projects are governed by this policy and each Project's chosen license, known as the “Project Code License”.

1. **License Options:** Projects can select from approved licenses:
   - [The Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)
   - [The MIT License][MIT]
   - [The 2-Clause BSD License](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause)
   - [The 3-Clause BSD License](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause)

   Other open source licenses require [Commonhaus Foundation Council (CFC)][cc] approval.

2. **Collaborations with Upstream Projects:** When collaborating with external open source projects (“Upstream Projects”), Projects must:

   - Comply with the Upstream Project's licensing requirements.
   - Prioritize compatibility.
   - Seek alternative license approvals from the CFC when necessary.

3. **Contributions:** Unless approved by the CFC:

   - All code contributions must be under the Project Code License, validated by a [Developers Certificate of Origin (DCO)][DCO].
   - All documentation and media files should use a license chosen by the Project’s technical governing body (for example, [CFC BY 4.0][CFC BY 4.0] or [MIT License][MIT]).
   - License information should label all contributed files.

4. **Policy Changes:** The CFC can modify this policy after notifying the Projects.

5. **Additional Requirements:** Projects can have additional contribution requirements.

6. **Intellectual Property Rights:** CF membership does not grant or transfer intellectual property rights unless explicitly stated by this policy or a Project's license.

For detailed guidance on implementing this policy, refer to the [IP Policy Guidance][].
