## Trademark Definitions and Ownership

The Commonhaus Foundation owns all CF trademarks, both registered and unregistered. A comprehensive list of registered trademarks, pending registrations, and trademarks in use can be found at https://trademark-list.website.

### Ownership and Specific Project Trademarks

While all trademarks are owned by the Commonhaus Foundation, each CF project may have its own (unique) set of trademarks. These trademarks, along with any specific usage guidelines, will be documented in the project's `TRADEMARK.md` file.

In case of any inconsistency between the rules in a project's `TRADEMARK.md` file and this Trademark Policy, the project's specific rules will prevail.

## Trademark Usage Guidelines

This section explains how trademarks ensure consistent quality, and how you can use them without implying the endorsement of the Commonhaus Foundation.

Trademarks are used to provide assurance to the community of consistency with respect to the quality of products or services with which the mark is associated.

This policy aims to strike a balance between two key interests:

1) Ensuring that trademarks remain reliable indicators of the qualities that they have been created to preserve and 
2) Ensuring that community members are able to discuss Commonhaus Foundation and its projects and to accurately describe the relationship between the CF, CF projects, and the products and services offered by others.

A trademark provides the owner with an exclusive right to authorize or control the use of the mark.
Your right to use a mark of the Commonhaus Foundation is provided for in this policy and in the statement of permitted use, if any, that may accompany the trademark notice displayed on a CF project website or described in the project's `TRADEMARK.md` file.

A copyright license, even an open source copyright license, does not include an implied right or license to use a trademark that may be related to the project developing the licensed software or other materials.
Because open source licenses permit unrestricted modification of the copyrighted software, and the Commonhaus Foundation has no intention of interfering with that right, your right to use any specific trademark of the Commonhaus Foundation is not determined by your use of software made available under an open source license.
Your right to use a mark is conditioned upon conforming to other requirements that are directly related to the qualities that the specific mark has been created to preserve.

Proper use of Commonhaus Foundation trademarks by following these trademark usage guidelines protects the value of Commonhaus Foundation trademarks.
Any use of or reference to Commonhaus trademarks that is inconsistent with this trademark policy, or use of marks that are confusingly similar to trademarks of the Commonhaus Foundation, is prohibited.
All uses of Commonhaus Foundation trademarks, and all goodwill associated therewith, will inure solely to the benefit of the Commonhaus Foundation, and Commonhaus Foundation projects.

## Guidelines for Commonhaus Trademarks

Understanding and respecting trademark rules are vital for preserving the integrity and recognition of a brand. These guidelines outline how to correctly use any trademark, especially those associated with the Commonhaus Foundation.

### General Trademark Rules

- **Nature of Use:**
    - Trademarks should be used as adjectives followed by a generic noun, not as verbs or nouns.
    - Avoid using trademarks in plural or possessive forms.
    - Do not alter trademarks. This includes shortening, hyphenating, abbreviating, or breaking them into parts.

- **Domain and Design:**
    - Trademarks must not form any part of domain names or product names.
    - Do not incorporate trademarks into company logos or designs.

- **Trademark Notices:**
    - Always provide a notice on the primary appearance of a trademark.
    - Do not modify trademark symbols. For instance, ™ should not be altered to an ® without the owner's consent. If in doubt regarding a mark's registration, contact the Commonhaus Foundation.

### Specific Rules for Commonhaus Foundation Trademarks

- **Correct Usage:**
    - Use trademarks in their most up-to-date form.
    - Ensure trademarks distinguish from surrounding text, e.g., by capitalizing or using distinct fonts.
    - Mention that usage doesn't imply the foundation's endorsement unless explicitly stated.

- **Prohibited Activities:**
  - Avoid generic usage of trademarks.
  - Avoid pluralizing, making possessive, or combining trademarks with other brands.
  - Don't create domain names with the Commonhaus Foundation trademarks without permission.

- **Additional Guidance:**
  - If building a product on a CF project, follow specific naming protocols.
  - Clarify rules about merchandising items featuring the trademarks.
  - Offer guidelines for open-source projects that use or build upon CF projects.

- **Approval:**
  - The Commonhaus Foundation has the discretion to review and decide on any trademark usage, even if not explicitly detailed in the policy.

### Visual Trademark Instructions

To maintain the integrity of The Commonhaus Foundation's visual trademarks:

- **Color:** Stick to official colors. Any deviations can weaken brand recognition.
- **Size:** Maintain a minimum size ([specific dimensions]) to ensure legibility.
- **Spacing:** Keep a clear boundary around the logo ([specific dimension]) clear of other elements.
- **Alterations:** Preserve the original logo. Avoid distortions, rotations, and other modifications.
- **Background:** Ensure that the logo is set against contrasting backgrounds for visibility.

## Commonhaus Trademarks and Crowdfunding

Want to use a Commonhaus trademark for crowdfunding? Here's what you need to know and do.

The Commonhaus Foundation recognizes that some projects may wish to use a project trademark when raising funds through crowdfunding platforms.
These activities are not official foundation efforts, even if they are coordinated by core participants from our projects. 
Since crowdfunding operates externally to the Commonhaus Foundation, you must obtain permission before using a Commonhaus trademark on any crowdfunding page.

In exchange for using the mark, the Commonhaus requires the administrator of the crowdfunding effort to adhere to these three policies:

1. You must have a policy that contributors and recipients disclose their legal or known names and company affiliations to the administrator of the funds.

2. Projects must be clear about how they decide to distribute funds to individual contributors.

3. You must include the following disclaimer on the crowdfunding page, replacing [Project Name] with the name of the project whose logo you plan to use:

> "This crowdfunding page supports independent contributors of the [Project Name] open source project. 
> The Commonhaus Foundation does not endorse, administer, or control this page. 
> Donations made here will go directly to the individuals contributing to [Project Name], and not to the Commonhaus Foundation. 
> The [Project Name] marks are used under license from the Commonhaus Foundation for the open source community's benefit."

To request permission to use a mark, please contact `info@mailing-list`.

Finally, if you are raising money through crowdfunding, be aware that you are not acting on behalf of the Commonhaus Foundation. It is your responsibility to know and follow all applicable laws.

We can't guarantee that our trademarks won't infringe on others, and we're not responsible for actions taken under this policy. If you use our trademarks, you'll have to defend us against any legal claims.

- The Commonhaus Foundation does not make any express or implied warranties, including but not limited to the warranties of non-infringement of any third party intellectual property rights.
- The Commonhaus Foundation does not warrant that any pending trademark applications for Commonhaus trademarks will result in any granted trademark protection.
