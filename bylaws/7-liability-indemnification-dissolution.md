# Liability, Indemnification, and Dissolution

## Liability

[CF Council][cfc] (CFC) Councilors and officers are not personally liable for actions undertaken in their official capacity, except in cases of willful misconduct or gross negligence.

## Insurance

**Decision-making:** The CFC is responsible for evaluating and deciding on the insurance needs of the Foundation. This includes assessing the necessity and feasibility of various insurance coverages.

**Types of Insurance:** The CFC shall consider maintaining insurance policies appropriate for the Foundation’s activities and risks, such as Directors and Officers (D&O) Liability insurance, property insurance, and liability insurance for events.

**Regular Review:** The insurance policies will be reviewed regularly, at least annually, to ensure they remain adequate and align with the Foundation's evolving needs and circumstances.

## Indemnification

The CF commits to protecting Councilors, officers, and other key personnel against legal risks associated with their roles. In cases arising from their duties, we provide indemnification for expenses and liabilities, under the following conditions:

- Protection excludes acts of willful misconduct or gross negligence.
- Those seeking indemnification must notify the Foundation promptly, enabling review and confirmation that the case aligns with our policy guidelines.

## Dissolution and Asset Distribution

In the unfortunate event that the Commonhaus Foundation (CF) must dissolve, we commit to a responsible and lawful closure process, prioritizing the continuity and integrity of our open-source projects.
Given that CF projects represent collaborative effort of individual contributors, the dissolution process will respect the unique structure and community-driven nature of each project.

## Dissolution Steps

1. **Settling Liabilities:** All outstanding debts or obligations incurred by the Foundation will be paid off.
2. **Prioritizing Project Continuity:** Before distributing any remaining assets, we will first seek to ensure the continuity of CF projects.
    Preference will be given to transferring projects, including associated trademarks and other intellectual property, to entities capable of supporting the ongoing mission of these projects. This could include other nonprofit groups classified under Section 501(c)(3), business leagues under 501(c)(6), or similar entities aligned with our goals. Our primary aim is to preserve the projects' integrity and purpose, rather than liquidating assets for debt repayment.
3. **Asset Distribution:** Only after all efforts have been made to secure a future for our projects will remaining assets be distributed in accordance with legal requirements and our mission.
4. **Compliance and Court Involvement:** Asset distribution will comply with Section 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code, with a court’s involvement if necessary, to decide on the recipients aligned with our mission, should no suitable organization be identified.

### Procedures for Dissolution

- **Decision to Dissolve:** The decision to dissolve the CF must be approved by a supermajority vote of the CF Council (CFC).
- **Notification:** Upon the decision to dissolve, members, stakeholders, and relevant authorities must be notified.
- **Asset Distribution:** Assets will be allocated in accordance with the dissolution clause and any legal requirements.
- **Finalization:** All final legal steps required to complete the dissolution will be taken, including filing necessary documents with the appropriate authorities.
- **Record Keeping:** Records of the dissolution process will be maintained for legal and historical purposes, following the same procedures as outlined in the CF [Record Keeping Policy][record-keeping].
