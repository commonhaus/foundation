## Section A: Amendments

### A.1 Overview

The authoritative copy of CF Bylaws bylaws is maintained in a dedicated GitHub repository. This ensures transparency, version control, and accessibility. CF Bylaws may be amended at any time. The amendment process is designed to be transparent, inclusive, and efficient.

### A.2 Amendment Procedure

1. **Proposal Submission:** Amendments are proposed via a GitHub pull request (PR) in the Bylaws repository. This PR should detail the changes and their rationale.

2. **Categorization of Changes:** The CFC reviews each proposal to classify it as either 'Trivial' (e.g., typographical corrections) or 'Substantive' (affecting governance or operations). Trivial Changes may be quickly approved, whereas Substantive Changes undergo a detailed review.

3. **Community Involvement:** For Substantive Changes, a 30-day review period allows all CF members to provide feedback. Member involvement is crucial to ensure diverse perspectives are considered.

4. **Resolution Process:** The CFC addresses and resolves any member-raised objections, ensuring consensus and addressing concerns.

5. **CFC Approval:** A supermajority vote from the CFC is required to approve and adopt the amendment.

6. **Implementation:** Approved amendments are promptly reflected in the Bylaws repository, with the changes effective immediately unless otherwise specified.

This process ensures that amendments to the Bylaws are made with consideration, transparency, and the consensus of the CF community.
