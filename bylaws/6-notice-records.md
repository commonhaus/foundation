## Notice

The CF recognizes the importance of efficient and accessible communication, given that members will be globally distributed and predominantly remote. To ensure transparency and fair decision-making, the following guidelines clarify when notice is required and how members can expedite processes.

Relevant Florida Statute(s):

- [617.0141](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2020/0617.0141) Notice.

### Electronic Notice

Notices given through the designated electronic channels are considered timely and effective. This approach is preferred due to the remote nature of the Foundation's operations, emphasizing the reliability of written communication over oral.

- **Outgoing Announcements:** All major announcements, including changes to bylaws, project membership status, or decisions needing member input, will be posted in GitHub Discussions and tagged with a `notice` label. Discussions with the `notice` label will be broadcast to the [`announce` mailing list][CONTACTS.yaml], `#notice` channel on the CF Discord server, published on the CF website and made available via an RSS feed.

- **Member Communications:** For official communications with the Council or Foundation, members can either send an email to the specified mailing lists or creating a discussion on GitHub. Refer to [Communication channels][contact-us] for current details on where and how to send notifications.

### Standard Waiting Periods

**General Decisions**: A minimum 72-hour waiting period is implemented for typical decisions, allowing adequate time for member objections and discussion. Refer to [Decision Making][] for further details.

**Bylaw Revisions**: Significant changes to the bylaws entail a longer, 30-day review period to ensure thorough member evaluation and input. See [Amendments][] for more information.

### Expedited Process

To streamline decision-making, CFC or EGC members may collectively agree to forego the standard notification procedure when appropriate. Such agreements can be reached via email or GitHub Discussions, especially in situations demanding prompt action.

The CFC and EGC members are urged to use this expedited process judiciously, ensuring that significant decisions are still afforded due consideration and discussion.

## Record Keeping

The CF will maintain records of all activities for transparency and legal compliance.

### Methods and Platforms

- **Digital Records:** Key documents such as meeting minutes, election information, and applications will be stored and versioned in GitHub repositories.
- **Legal Documents:** Essential legal documents and filings will be kept in both electronic and paper formats to ensure redundancy and compliance.

### Accessibility and Security

- **Transparency:** Non-confidential records will be accessible to all members, fostering transparency.
- **Confidentiality:** Sensitive records will be securely stored, with restricted access to protect privacy.

### Compliance and Management

- **Annual Reports** will be prepared and filed as per state and federal regulations, with accessibility as required by law.
- **Retention and Version Control**: Documents will adhere to legal requirements for retention periods and employ version control for historical accuracy.
- **Backup and Security:** Regular backups and robust security measures to safeguard digital records.
