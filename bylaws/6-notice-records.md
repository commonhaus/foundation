## Notice

The CF recognizes the importance of efficient and accessible communication, given that members will be globally distributed and predominantly remote. To ensure transparency and fair decision-making, the following guidelines clarify when notice is required and how members can expedite processes:

### Notification Requirements

- **Outgoing Announcements:** All major announcements, including changes to bylaws, project membership status, or decisions needing member input, will be initially posted in GitHub Discussions. These announcements will then be shared across other platforms (Discord) and through our blog/RSS feed.

- **Member Communications:** For official communications with the Council or Foundation, members can either send an email to the specified mailing lists or use the designated channels such as opening an issue or creating a discussion on GitHub. Refer to [Communication channels][contact-us] for current details on where and how to send notifications.

### Expedited Process

Electronic notice is considered timely and effective when sent through these means. While oral communication remains an option, it is primarily intended for exceptional circumstances, given the remote nature of Foundation operations.

For most decisions, a standard waiting period of at least 72 hours will be observed to allow time for objections and discussions (see [Decision Making][]).

For substantive revisions to the bylaws, a standard review period of 30 days will be observed (see [Amendments][]).

To expedite processes and reduce the time between posting the notice and taking action, members can collectively agree that formal notification is unnecessary. This decision can be made informally through email or GitHub Discussions and should consider the urgency of the matter. The emphasis is on timely action, and unnecessary delays should be avoided.

CF and CFC members are encouraged to use this mechanism responsibly, ensuring that important decisions still receive the appropriate attention and discussion.

## Record Keeping

The CF will maintain records of all activities for transparency and legal compliance.

### Methods and Platforms

- **Digital Records:** Key documents such as meeting minutes, election information, and applications will be stored and versioned in GitHub repositories.
- **Legal Documents:** Essential legal documents and filings will be kept in both electronic and paper formats to ensure redundancy and compliance.

### Accessibility and Security

- **Transparency:** Non-confidential records will be accessible to all members, fostering transparency.
- **Confidentiality:** Sensitive records will be securely stored, with restricted access to protect privacy.

### Compliance and Management

- **Annual Reports** will be prepared and filed as per state and federal regulations, with accessibility as required by law.
- **Retention and Version Control**: Documents will adhere to legal requirements for retention periods and employ version control for historical accuracy.
- **Backup and Security:** Regular backups and robust security measures to safeguard digital records.
