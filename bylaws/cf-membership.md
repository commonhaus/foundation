# Membership

It describes eligibility and requirements for different types of membership for projects and individuals.

## Project Membership

Joining the CF as a project member involves a few key steps:

- **Eligibility**: Projects must be original or substantial forks, demonstrating recent activity and significant usage. We value innovation and active community engagement.

- **Application Process**: Project leaders are invited to submit a comprehensive application outlining the project’s goals, current status, community size, and how it aligns with the CF’s mission *(TBD: Application link)*. The [CF Council][cfc] (CFC) will review each application, and may ask for further information or clarification.

- **Approval and Onboarding**: We provide onboarding support and resources to help integrate new projects seamlessly into our ecosystem.

## Project Leaders and Code Owners

Project Leaders and Code Owners are the pillars of their projects and the CF at large.

- **Responsibilities**: Managing access to project repositories and steering project direction and development. They ensure their projects adhere to CF policies, and collaborate with the CFC to ensure policies remain relevant and reduce procedural burden.
- **Membership and Voting Rights**: Project leaders and code owners are automatically eligible for CF membership, with voting rights and eligibility for CFC positions.

**Code Owners**: The Code Owners for a repository should be managed through `CODEOWNERS` files. To learn more about this role, see [About Code Owners](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners)

## General Members

General membership in the CF is open to all who share our mission and are eager to contribute.

- **How to Become a Member:** Get involved! Whether it’s coding, writing documentation, participating in community management, or advocating for the CF, your active involvement for three months earns you voting rights.
- **Applying for Membership:** Share your intent through a formal application *(TBD: Criteria and form)*. The CFC reviews each application, assessing contributions and alignment with CF values.

**Decisions and Transparency:** Our review process is transparent. Declined applicants receive explanations and can appeal. Our aim is always to be fair and act in the best interest of the CF community.

## Membership Dues and Renewal

While the CF thrives on the passion and contributions of its members, nominal membership dues play a small but vital role in sustaining our operations.

- **The Role of Dues:** These nominal fees support administrative tasks to ensure the smooth functioning of the CF.
- **Annual Renewal:** The initial payment of dues and the annual renewal process reaffirms your commitment to CF values and agreement to abide by its policies.

Your involvement in the CF, whether as a project member, a leader, or a general member, shapes the future of open-source innovation. We value each contribution and encourage active participation in our diverse and vibrant community.

## Inactive or Retired Members

Life happens, and we understand that. Members may choose to step back or retire, and we respect that decision. 

- **Voluntary Resignation:** Members can choose to retire at any time, transitioning to an emeritus or inactive role while remaining part of our community.
- **Inactivity:** Members who are inactive for more than 12 months will transition to an inactive status. They can reactivate their membership by contacting the CFC.

Inactive members (of any type) do not have the right to vote in CFC elections and are ineligible for membership in the CFC.

## Suspension and Revocation of Membership

The CFC may suspend or revoke the membership of any member that is found to be in violation of CF policies or acting against the best interests of the CF community.

- **Suspension:** The CFC may suspend a member for up to 90 days, during which the member may not participate in CF activities or vote in CFC elections. 
- **Revocation:** The CFC may act to revoke or suspend CF membership if it believes (in good faith) that the member is engaging in willful misconduct or harming the best interest of the CF and its members.

These situations will be recorded as violations of the [Code of Conduct][coc] and handled as per the [Code of Conduct Resolution process][coc-reports].

The decision to revoke or suspend membership is made by a supermajority vote of the CFC. The member in question will be notified of the decision and the reasons for it.
