# Membership

It describes eligibility and requirements for different types of membership for projects and individuals.

## Project Membership

We evaluate projects based on ownership, activity, usage, and originality. To be considered, projects must:

- Be novel or a substantial fork of an existing project.
- Show recent activity and/or significant usage as measured by downloads from a central package repository (Maven Central, GitHub Packages, etc.).
- Comply with the [CF IP Policy][ip-policy].

Project Leaders can submit an application for their project to join the Commonhaus Foundation.
*TBD: Link to process for submitting a project to join*

### Project Leaders and Code Owners

Project Leaders and Code Owners play a crucial role in steering CF projects, shaping the foundation's future. Responsibilities include:

- Holding write permissions in project repositories (managed through the `CODEOWNERS` file).
- Full voting rights and automatic eligibility for CFC positions.

## General Members

General membership is open to anyone dedicated to our mission. Active members, contributing to CF or its projects within the past year, gain voting rights after three months. Contributions include:

- Repository contributions: code, documentation, design work.
- Community management, advocacy, or forum participation.
- Active participation in elections.

*TBD: Criteria and link to application form for general members*

### Membership Termination and Resignation

- **Voluntary Resignation:** Members can resign by notifying the CFC through a designated channel (e.g., email/form).
- **Revocation of Membership:** The CFC may dismiss members for behavior inconsistent with CF's mission or values. This process includes a review and an opportunity for the member to respond.
