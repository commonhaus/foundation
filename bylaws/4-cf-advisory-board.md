# Commonhaus Foundation Advisory Board

The Commonhaus Foundation (CF) Advisory Board comprises representatives from organizations and companies that support the CF. It acts as a bridge between the CF and the broader tech industry, providing diverse insights and strategic guidance to inform CF Council (CFC) decisions.

The Advisory Board does not have decision-making authority. Members or employees of participating organizations and companies may be [members of the CF][membership], but must vote in their own name, free of any pressure from their organization or company.

However, the Advisory Board plays a crucial role in shaping the foundation's direction through advice and industry perspectives. The structure is designed to ensure robust representation and dialogue:

- **Representation**: Each Advisory Board member organization may appoint up to two representatives. This dual representation maximizes the likelihood of attendance and ensures a breadth of perspectives, mirroring the Gnome Foundation's approach to encourage diverse viewpoints from vendors.

- **Diversity of Insight**: Where possible, organizations are encouraged to appoint representatives who bring different types of expertise or experience, such as a managerial and a technical perspective, to contribute to a well-rounded advisory process.

- **Meetings**: The Advisory Board convenes with the CFC semi-annually, providing a platform for collaborative review and feedback on the CF's direction, initiatives, and impact on the industry.

- **Communication**: Representatives are expected to actively communicate the needs and concerns of their organizations, while also conveying the goals and achievements of the CF to their respective constituencies.

- **Engagement**: The Advisory Board's engagement is pivotal in aligning the CF's strategic initiatives with industry needs, ensuring that the foundation remains relevant and responsive to the ecosystem it serves.

An up-to-date list of Advisory Board representatives will be maintained in the `advisory-board` [CONTACTS.yaml][] attribute.
