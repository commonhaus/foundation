# Commonhaus Foundation Advisory Board

The Commonhaus Foundation (CF) Advisory Board comprises representatives from organizations and companies that support the CF. It serves as a bridge between the CF and the broader tech industry, providing diverse insights and strategic guidance to inform CF Council (CFC) decisions.

Although the Advisory Board does not possess decision-making authority, it helps shape the foundation’s direction through its advisory capacity.

> Members or employees of participating organizations and companies may be [members of the CF][membership], but must vote in their own name, free of any pressure from their organization or company.

The structure of the Advisory Board ensures robust representation and dialogue, designed to maximize the benefit of diverse industry perspectives:

- **Representation**: Each Advisory Board member organization may appoint up to two representatives.
This dual representation maximizes the likelihood of attendance and ensures a breadth of perspectives, mirroring the GNOME Foundation's approach to encourage diverse viewpoints from vendors.

- **Diversity of Insight**: Organizations are encouraged to appoint representatives with different types of expertise or experience, such as managerial and technical perspectives, to contribute to a well-rounded advisory process.

- **Meetings**: The Advisory Board meets with the CFC semi-annually for collaborative review and feedback on the CF’s direction, initiatives, and industry impact.

- **Communication**: Representatives are expected to actively communicate their organizations’ needs and concerns while conveying the goals and achievements of the CF to their constituencies.

- **Engagement**: The Advisory Board’s engagement helps align the CF’s strategic initiatives with industry needs, ensuring the foundation remains relevant and responsive to its ecosystem.

An up-to-date list of Advisory Board representatives will be maintained in the `advisory-board` [CONTACTS.yaml][] attribute.
