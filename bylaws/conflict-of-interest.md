## 4.1 Definition of Conflict of Interest

A conflict of interest occurs when an individual's personal, professional, or financial interests could potentially interfere with or influence their decisions or actions on behalf of the CF.

### Examples

- Financial interest in any entity with which CF transacts.
- Board membership, employment, or volunteer work with such an entity.
- Personal gifts or loans from any entity dealing with CF.
- Relationship with another nonprofit competing for the same resources.
- Personal or business relationships affecting CF decisions.

## 4.2 Disclosing Potential Conflicts of Interest

### 4.2.1 Immediate Disclosure

All individuals must disclose any potential conflict of interest as soon as it is recognized. This disclosure should be made to the CFC or a designated point of contact.

### 4.2.2 Annual Disclosure

Each member of the CFC and officers must provide an annual statement declaring any known potential conflicts of interest.

## 4.3 Managing Conflicts

Upon the disclosure of a potential conflict, the individual involved must abstain from participating in discussions or decision-making processes related to the matter. The CFC will review the situation and determine the appropriate course of action.

## 4.4 Transparency and Documentation

All discussions and decisions related to conflicts of interest must be documented and included in the minutes of the CFC meetings.

## 4.5 Prohibited Acts

The CF will not engage in transactions where there is a direct conflict of interest with a CFC member, officer, or key person, unless it is in the best interest of the CF and has been thoroughly vetted and approved by the CFC.

## 4.6 Guidelines for Gifts and Hospitality

Members should not accept gifts, favors, or hospitality that might appear to influence their decision-making or actions on behalf of the CF.

## 4.7 Training and Compliance

Members will be provided with information and training to understand and adhere to this policy. Failure to comply may result in corrective action, including potential removal from their position within the CF.

## 4.8 Procedures for Determining Compensation

When hiring staff or paying for contract work, the CFC will reference industry standards to ensure compensation is fair and justified. The process will be transparent and fully documented.

All individuals will abstain from discussions or votes concerning their own compensation or that of those closely associated with them.

## 4.9 Review of Policy

This policy will be reviewed periodically to ensure it remains relevant and effective. Any amendments will be approved by the CFC.
