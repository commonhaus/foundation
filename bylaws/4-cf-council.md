# Commonhaus Foundation Council and Offices

The Commonhaus Foundation Council (CFC) serves as the Board of Directors for the Commonhaus Foundation (CF).
It oversees the foundation's operations, ensuring compliance with legal requirements and the execution of strategic plans as defined in our Articles of Incorporation and [Bylaws][bylaws].
This includes financial management, operational decisions, and adherence to state and federal regulations.

While the [Extended Governance Committee (EGC)](#extended-governance-committee-egc) provides broad governance input, the CFC is specifically tasked with the practical application of these strategies, managing the foundation's daily administrative and legal tasks to support its goals and mission.

**Postponing Meetings**: If there aren't enough Councilors for a quorum, those present can postpone the meeting without additional [notice](#notice-for-cfc-meetings). The meeting will be rescheduled when a quorum can be met.

**Adjustments for Disqualifications**: If any councilor is disqualified from a particular matter (for example, abstention due to a conflict of interest), the quorum is adjusted to exclude them. Similarly, suspended Councilors are not counted for quorum purposes.

## Electronic Participation and Decision-Making

Authenticated digital actions, such as comments and reactions on GitHub, are valid forms of written consent, equivalent to formal written agreements. The CFC, EGC, and other committees may make decisions asynchronously.

A decision can be made once a quorum of participation is met, and there are no unresolved objections during the designated time period.

- **Majority Voting**: Most decisions are subject to a simple majority vote of Councilors present and voting at a meeting or all Councilors when acting through [written consent](#electronic-participation-and-decision-making).

- **Supermajority Voting**: Certain critical decisions require approval by two-thirds of voting members (CFC or EGC) with a quorum present or participating. This applies whether in a meeting or through [written consent](#electronic-participation-and-decision-making).
