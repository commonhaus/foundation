# Liability and Indemnification

## Liability

[CF Council][cfc] (CFC) members and officers are not personally liable for actions undertaken in their official capacity, except in cases of willful misconduct or gross negligence.

## Insurance

**Decision-making:** The CFC is responsible for evaluating and deciding on the insurance needs of the Foundation. This includes assessing the necessity and feasibility of various insurance coverages.

**Types of Insurance:** The CFC shall consider maintaining insurance policies appropriate for the Foundationâ€™s activities and risks, such as Directors and Officers (D&O) Liability insurance, property insurance, and liability insurance for events.

**Regular Review:** The insurance policies will be reviewed regularly, at least annually, to ensure they remain adequate and align with the Foundation's evolving needs and circumstances.

## Indemnification

The CF commits to protecting CFC members, officers, and other key personnel against legal risks associated with their roles. In cases arising from their duties, we provide indemnification for expenses and liabilities, under the following conditions:

- Protection excludes acts of willful misconduct or gross negligence.
- Those seeking indemnification must notify the Foundation promptly, enabling review and confirmation that the case aligns with our policy guidelines.
