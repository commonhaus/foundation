## 6.1 License Selection and Usage

CF projects can use any [open-source license approved by the Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/licenses/) (OSI). The CF is most familiar with the following four licenses, which can simplify the review process:

- [The Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)
- [The MIT License][MIT]
- [The 2-Clause BSD License](https://opensource.org/license/bsd-2-clause/)
- [The 3-Clause BSD License](https://opensource.org/license/bsd-3-clause/)

Selection of other OSI-approved licenses is permitted but may require additional review by the [Commonhaus Foundation Council][cfc] (CFC).

## 6.2 Contributions

Code contributions should comply with the project's chosen license.

Contributions are validated through a [Developer Certificate of Origin][DCO] (DCO) or a Contributor License Agreement (CLA), as determined by the project.

### 6.2.1 Documentation and Media Files

Projects should choose an appropriate license for documentation and media files, such as [CC BY 4.0][] or the project's primary license.

All contributions must be clearly labeled with license information.

## 6.3 Collaborations and External Projects

When collaborating with external open-source projects ("Upstream Projects"):

- Comply with the Upstream Project's licensing requirements.
- Prioritize compatibility
- Seek alternative license approvals from the CFC when necessary.

## 6.4 Intellectual Property Rights

CF membership does not grant or transfer intellectual property rights unless explicitly stated by this policy or a Project's license.

## 6.5 Implementing the IP Policy

Project leaders should ensure compliance with this policy and provide clear guidance to contributors.

- Use the [standard website footer][] for member project websites,
- Ensure that contribution guidelines are updated and accessible, and
- (optionally) Maintain accurate copyright statements.

### 6.5.1 Copyright Statements

Using [copyright statements in your code][code-copyright] is a practice with mixed adoption.

If your project wants to add copyrights to source code, we recommend one of the following:

- Copyright &lt;year of file creation> The XYZ Authors.
- Copyright &lt;year of file creation> Contributors to the XYZ project.
- Copyright &lt;year of file creation> The original author or authors.

Updating the year after the file is created is unnecessary.

Do not alter existing copyright lines unless you have the right to do so.

## 6.6 Obtaining an Exemption

If the [IP Policy][] doesn't cater to your project's needs, request special permission from the CFC.

[Steps to request an exemption TBD]

## 6.7 Policy Changes and Additional Requirements

The CF Council reserves the right to modify this policy. Projects may have additional contribution requirements, provided they align with this policy and are clearly communicated to contributors.

For detailed guidance on implementing this policy or for assistance, projects can contact `legal@mailing-list`.
