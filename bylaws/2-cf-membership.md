# Membership

The Commonhaus Foundation (CF) is a membership organization. Your involvement in the CF, whether as a project representative or a general member, shapes the future of open-source innovation. We value each contribution and encourage active participation in our diverse and vibrant community.

The following section outlines the different types of membership and the process for becoming a member.

- [Projects](#projects)
- [Project Representation](#project-representation)
- [General Members](#general-members)
- [Membership Rights and Requirements](#membership-rights-and-requirements)
- [Membership Dues and Renewal](#membership-dues-and-renewal)
- [Inactive or Retired Members](#inactive-or-retired-members)
- [Suspension and Revocation of Membership](#suspension-and-revocation-of-membership)

## Projects

A **project** within the CF represents collaborative innovation in open-source technology. These projects are dynamic collectives of individual contributors, functioning as self-organizing units rather than formal legal entities.[^1]

**Flexible and Inclusive Structure:** Projects can vary in size and scope, ranging from individual repositories to entire collections of repositories. Whether it's a single focused effort or a collection of related initiatives, each project is defined by common goals and shared assets, including code, trademarks, and domains.

[^1]: Contributors may be affiliated with various organizations or companies, but they contribute as individuals.

## Project Representation

**Diverse Voices, Unified Decision-Making:** Each project within the Commonhaus Foundation (CF) has its unique perspective, and its own legitimate interests in decisions taken by the foundation as a whole. To ensure that every project has a say in the direction of the foundation, each project appoints a representative to the [Extended Governance Committee (EGC)][egc]. The representative is chosen according to the project's own governance practices. The representative is not required to have or maintain general membership of the foundation.

**Dedicated Representation:** If an EGC representative is elected to the [CF Council (CFC)][cfc], we recommend appointing an additional representative for the EGC to ensure project-specific needs are represented.

## General Members

**Join as an individual.** Membership to the CF is open to all individuals who share our mission and meet the outlined eligibility criteria[^3].

- **Eligibility Criteria**: Eligibility requires active and meaningful engagement with CF or its projects for at least three months.
    Meaningful contributions include commits and merged pull requests (code, documentation, or applications for demonstration, education, or advocacy); triage, maintainer or moderator roles for CF project repositories; or substantive participation in community forums.
- **Application Process:** Submit an application to formalize membership (*details TBD*).
    The CFC reviews applications to ensure eligibility criteria are met.
- **Transparent Review Process:** Applicants satisfying criteria are accepted.
    Declinations are clearly explained based on set criteria, with an appeal process available for further evaluation.

[^3]: Companies (or similar legal entities) can ensure their views are represented by appointing a representative to the [advisory board][].

## Membership Rights and Requirements

As a member, you're not just a part of our community; you shape its future. You're entitled to:

- **Voice and Vote**: Contribute to discussions, sponsor issues, and vote in elections and referendums.

    Companies can engage through the [advisory board][].

## Membership Dues and Renewal

While the CF thrives on the passion and contributions of its members, nominal membership dues play a small but vital role in sustaining our operations.

- **The Role of Dues:** These nominal fees support administrative tasks to ensure the smooth functioning of the CF.
- **Annual Renewal:** The initial payment of dues and the annual renewal process reaffirms your commitment to CF values and agreement to abide by its policies.

## Inactive or Retired Members

Life happens, and we understand that. Members may choose to step back or retire, and we respect that decision.

- **Voluntary Resignation:** Members can choose to retire at any time, transitioning to an emeritus or inactive role while remaining part of our community.
- **Inactivity:** Members who fail to meet the [eligibility criteria](#general-members) for 12 months will transition to an inactive status.

Inactive members (of any type) do not have the right to vote in CFC elections and are ineligible for membership in the CFC.

To transition from inactive to active status, a member must meet [eligibility criteria](#general-members) for active membership.

## Suspension and Revocation of Membership

- **Revocation:** The CFC may act to revoke or suspend membership if it believes (in good faith) that the member is engaging in willful misconduct.

These situations will be recorded as violations of the [Code of Conduct][coc] and handled as per the [Code of Conduct Resolution process][coc-reports].

The decision to revoke or suspend membership is made by a supermajority vote of the CFC. The member in question will be notified of the decision and the reasons for it.
