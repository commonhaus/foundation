# Membership

The Commonhaus Foundation (CF) is a membership organization. Your involvement in the CF, whether as a project member, a leader, or a general member, shapes the future of open-source innovation. We value each contribution and encourage active participation in our diverse and vibrant community.

The following section outlines the different types of membership and the process for becoming a member.

- [General Members](#general-members)

## Projects

A **project** within the Commonhaus Foundation is a collaborative effort in open-source technology. Although not formal legal entities, projects are self-organizing collectives of contributors, encompassing everything from single repositories to entire GitHub organizations. They include various
assets such as code, trademarks, and domains.

## Project Leaders and Code Owners

Each CF project is represented by a nominated **Project Leader**.

- **Nomination and Representation:** Each project, through its own governance process, nominates one Project Leader as a member of the [Extended Governance Committee (EGC)][egc]. This ensures equitable representation across the CF.
- **Additional Nomination for Council Members**: If a Project Leader also serves on the CF Council, an additional leader from the project is nominated to the EGC. This ensures that the project continues to have dedicated representation, while the Council member focuses on broader CF issues.

**Code Owners:** The `CODEOWNERS` file in a GitHub project ororganization's repository specifies individuals responsible for code in a repository.  Nominated Project Leaders should be listed in their project's CODEOWNERS file. The CF wants to ensure that individuals representing the project on the EGC have a demonstrable commitment to that project's ongoing health and success.

For more details, see [About Code Owners](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners).

## General Members

**Join as an individual.** Membership to the CF is open to all individuals who share our mission and are willing to contribute[^1]. 

- **Path to Membership:** Engage with the CF or one of its projects in any capacity for three months to gain eligibility. Whether it's contributing code, documentation, community management, or advocacy, your active participation is the key to becoming a member.
- **Application Process:** To formalize your membership, submit an application (*details TBD*). The CFC will review each application, focusing on your contributions and alignment with our values. 

Our review process is transparent. Declined applicants receive explanations and can appeal. Our aim is always to be fair and act in the best interest of the CF community.

[^1]: Companies (or similar legal entities) can ensure their views are represented by appointing a representative to the [advisory board][].

## Membership Rights and Requirements

As a CF member, you're not just a part of our community; you shape its future. You're entitled to:

- **Voice and Vote**: Contribute to discussions, sponsor issues, and vote in elections and referendums.
- **Individual Representation:** Remember, your membership represents you, not your employer or any legal entity. Companies can engage through the [advisory board][].

## Membership Dues and Renewal

While the CF thrives on the passion and contributions of its members, nominal membership dues play a small but vital role in sustaining our operations.

- **The Role of Dues:** These nominal fees support administrative tasks to ensure the smooth functioning of the CF.
- **Annual Renewal:** The initial payment of dues and the annual renewal process reaffirms your commitment to CF values and agreement to abide by its policies.

## Inactive or Retired Members

Life happens, and we understand that. Members may choose to step back or retire, and we respect that decision. 

- **Voluntary Resignation:** Members can choose to retire at any time, transitioning to an emeritus or inactive role while remaining part of our community.
- **Inactivity:** Members who are inactive for more than 12 months will transition to an inactive status. They can reactivate their membership by contacting the CFC.

Inactive members (of any type) do not have the right to vote in CFC elections and are ineligible for membership in the CFC.

## Suspension and Revocation of Membership

The CFC may suspend or revoke the membership of any member that is found to be in violation of CF policies or acting against the best interests of the CF community.

- **Suspension:** The CFC may suspend a member for up to 90 days, during which the member may not participate in CF activities or vote in CFC elections. 
- **Revocation:** The CFC may act to revoke or suspend CF membership if it believes (in good faith) that the member is engaging in willful misconduct or harming the best interest of the CF and its members.

These situations will be recorded as violations of the [Code of Conduct][coc] and handled as per the [Code of Conduct Resolution process][coc-reports].

The decision to revoke or suspend membership is made by a supermajority vote of the CFC. The member in question will be notified of the decision and the reasons for it.
