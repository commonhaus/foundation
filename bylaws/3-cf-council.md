# Commonhaus Foundation Council and Offices

The Commonhaus Foundation Council (CFC) serves as the Board of Directors for the Commonhaus Foundation (CF).
It oversees the foundation's operations, ensuring compliance with legal requirements and the execution of strategic plans as defined in our Articles of Incorporation and [Bylaws][bylaws].
This includes financial management, operational decisions, and adherence to state and federal regulations.
