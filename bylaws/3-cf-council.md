## Composition and Membership

The CFC comprises elected members recognized for their contributions to the open-source community. As representatives of diverse organizations, CFC members are committed to prioritizing the interests of the CF community in their decision-making.

An up-to-date list of CFC members will be maintained in the `cf-council` [CONTACTS.yaml][] attribute.

**Structure:** The CFC is composed of a minimum of 3 elected members: 1 [CFC Chairperson](#cfc-chairperson) and at least 2 members-at-large. One-third of the CFC members must be direct representatives of CF projects to ensure a balanced representation of project needs and perspectives.

**Conflicts of Interest:** All members are required to adhere to the [Conflict of Interest Policy][coi-policy], and must disclose any potential conflicts of interest, especially those related to their employment. This commitment to transparency helps maintain the integrity of the CFC's decisions.

**Selection and Elections:** The selection process for CFC members is designed to reflect the diversity of the open-source community.

- Any member that has been active within the CF community for at least six months can run or be nominated.
- Every active CF member is entitled to one vote in annual [elections][].

### Tenure, Transition and Apportioning Duties

- **Staggered Elections:** To maintain continuity, no more than two-thirds of the CFC seats are up for re-election in each cycle.
- **Resignation:** CFC members wishing to resign must formally notify the Chairperson or the CFC, with immediate cessation of their responsibilities and rights as CFC members upon resignation.
- **Removal:** A CFC member may be removed for misconduct, failure to perform duties, or consistent non-participation. The removal process includes a fair review, an opportunity for the member to respond, and a decision made through a vote by the remaining CFC members or a general membership vote.
- **Vacancies:** In the event of a vacancy, duties are temporarily assigned to remaining members until a special election can be held to fill the vacated seat.
- **Apportioning Duties:** The CFC must ensure that all required [CFC Offices](#officer-roles-and-appointment) are filled. 

### Officer Roles and Appointment

- **Appointment of Officers:** Following each election, the CFC may review and reassign officer roles as needed. This ensures that roles align with the current composition and skills of the CFC.

- **Officer Roles**: The CFC includes the roles of Chairperson, Secretary, and Treasurer. Additional roles can be established based on the needs of the Foundation.

  - **[CFC Chairperson](#cfc-chairperson):** Oversees CFC meetings and is involved in resolving [Code of Conduct issues][coc-reports].
  - **Secretary:** Manages records, oversees official correspondence, and ensures accurate meeting minutes.
  - **Treasurer:** Handles financial affairs, including budgeting, financial reporting, and coordinating with fiscal hosts or agents.

- **Officers and Staff:** The CFC may appoint CF general members as officers or hire staff to manage specific administrative functions. These officers and staff are not considered CFC members and do not have voting rights. 
  - Officers may be invited to attend CFC meetings as non-voting participants
  - Officers may resign at any time by notice to the CFC.

### CFC Chairperson

The Chairperson orchestrates regular CFC meetings, ensuring leadership in discussions is evenly spread. They also oversee the proper handling of [Code of Conduct reports and escalations][coc-reports].

#### Officers and Staff

The CFC may appoint CF general members as officers or hire staff to manage specific administrative functions. These officers and staff are not considered CFC members and do not have voting rights.

- Officers may be invited to attend CFC meetings as non-voting participants
- Officers may resign at any time by notice to the CFC.

## Meetings, Procedures and Decision-Making

The CFC conducts meetings primarily through electronic means (like Zoom or Google Meet) to accommodate its globally distributed and remote members. Key points:

- **Frequency:** Regular meetings of the CFC are held quarterly for strategic and operational discussions.
- **Platform:** Online tools facilitating video and voice interactions are used for remote participation.
- **Annual General Meeting (AGM):** Conducted via online platforms, the AGM reviews the annual report and sets plans.
- **Special General Meetings:** Called for specific purposes, they can also be held electronically.

### Agendas, Access, and Records

- **Agenda Setting:** Agendas are prepared in advance, incorporating items proposed by CFC members and the general membership.
- **Public Access:** Meetings are generally open to the public, except for confidential matters.
- **Meeting Minutes:** Minutes and summaries of key decisions and discussions are stored in a GitHub repository as per our [Record Keeping policy][records].

### Electronic Participation and Action by Written Consent

Efficient participation and decision-making are essential for geographically dispersed CFC members. Here's how electronic methods are used:

- **Remote Involvement:** CFC members actively participate in meetings through teleconferencing or video conferencing tools.
- **Decision Making Outside Meetings:** Decisions can be made through written consent, following the [decision-making process][consensus], with proper [notice][] and [record keeping][records].
- **Effectiveness:** Actions by written consent require majority approval, suitable for urgent or straightforward decisions.

### Quorum for Meetings

- **Quorum Requirement:** A quorum at any CFC meeting requires attendance by a majority of the total number of CFC members to ensure decisions are made with adequate participation and representation.
- **Adjournment in Absence of Quorum:** If a quorum is not present at a meeting, a majority of the CFC members present may adjourn the meeting until a quorum is achieved.
- **Reduced Quorum for Disqualified Members:** If any CFC member is disqualified from voting on a particular matter, the quorum required for that matter is reduced accordingly. Suspended CFC members (if any) are also not counted for the purposes of quorum.

### Decision-Making Process

- **Consensus-Based Approach:** The CFC strives to make decisions based on consensus, adhering to the Lazy Consensus model outlined in [General Decision Making](#general-decision-making). This approach emphasizes collective agreement and accommodates diverse viewpoints.
- **Voting as a Last Resort:** If a consensus cannot be reached, the CFC resorts to voting. Decisions are then made by a simple majority of the voting CFC members present unless a supermajority is required.
- **Supermajority Requirement:** Certain critical decisions require a supermajority vote. A supermajority is defined as at least two-thirds of the total number of CFC members.

### Matters Requiring Supermajority Vote

The following matters must be approved by a supermajority vote of the CFC:

- Amending the Bylaws or Articles of Incorporation.
- Approving mergers, consolidations, or dissolution of the Foundation.
- Changing the size or eligibility requirements of the CFC.
- Major changes to the Foundation's structure or operations.
- Suspending or revoking membership for an individual or project.
- Any changes to the definition or rights of membership.
- Other significant decisions as determined by the CFC.

## Committees and Delegation

The CFC may form committees with specific purposes that are authorized to make recommendations but not final decisions on significant matters. Committees may consist of CFC members and other community contributors. They must keep regular [records][] and report to the CFC.

Certain critical actions (anything requiring a Supermajority vote) are reserved for the full CFC. Temporary or ad-hoc groups may be established for specific tasks, with the CFC retaining ultimate oversight and decision-making authority.
