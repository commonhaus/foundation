## Composition and Membership

The CFC comprises elected members recognized for their contributions to the open-source community. As representatives of diverse organizations, CFC members are committed to prioritizing the interests of the CF community in their decision-making.

An up-to-date list of CFC members will be maintained in the `cf-council` [CONTACTS.yaml][] attribute.

**Structure:** The CFC is composed of a minimum of 3 elected members: 1 [CFC Chairperson](#cfc-chairperson) and at least 2 members-at-large. One-third of the CFC members must be direct representatives of CF projects to ensure a balanced representation of project needs and perspectives.

**Conflicts of Interest:** All members must follow our [Conflict of Interest Policy][coi-policy], and must disclose any potential conflicts of interest.

**Selection and Elections:** The selection process for CFC members is designed to reflect the diversity of the open-source community.

- Any member that has been active within the CF community for at least six months can run or be nominated.
- Every active CF member is entitled to one vote in annual [elections][].

### Tenure, Transition and Apportioning Duties

- **Staggered Elections:** To maintain continuity, no more than two-thirds of the CFC seats are up for re-election in each cycle.
- **Resignation:** CFC members wishing to resign must formally notify the Chairperson or the CFC, with immediate cessation of their responsibilities and rights as CFC members upon resignation.
- **Removal:** A CFC member may be removed for misconduct, failure to perform duties, or consistent non-participation. The removal process includes a fair review, an opportunity for the member to respond, and a decision made through a vote by the remaining CFC members or a general membership vote.
- **Vacancies:** In the event of a vacancy, duties are temporarily assigned to remaining members until a special election can be held to fill the vacated seat.
- **Apportioning Duties:** The CFC must ensure that all required [CFC Offices](#officer-roles-and-appointment) are filled.

### Officer Roles and Appointment

Following elections, the CFC assesses and assigns officer roles. CF general members may be appointed as officers, or external staff hired, to support administrative functions. These non-CFC officers and staff assist with administrative tasks but do not have voting rights in CFC decisions.

The CFC's key roles are Chairperson, Secretary, and Treasurer. Additional roles may be created as needed.

- **CFC Chairperson**: The Chairperson orchestrates CFC meetings and ensures equitable participation and discussion. They oversee the processing of [Code of Conduct reports and escalations][coc-reports], and facilitate the progression of votes and decisions. Their role is pivotal in maintaining the integrity and efficiency of the CFC's operations.
- **Secretary**: The Secretary is responsible for managing the Foundation's records and overseeing official correspondence, including serving as a primary contact for marketing and outreach. They ensure the accuracy and maintenance of essential documents and communications, playing a key role in the Foundation's external and internal interactions.
- **Treasurer**: The Treasurer oversees the Foundation's financial management, including budgeting, financial reporting, and liaison with fiscal hosts or agents. They ensure financial transparency and accountability, vital for the Foundation's sustainability and trustworthiness.

#### CFC Chairperson

The Chairperson is instrumental in steering the operations of the CFC. Their key responsibilities are to:

- Organize and moderate regular CFC leadership meetings, ensuring balanced participation and effective discussion.
- Facilitate the progression of votes, ensuring that decisions are efficiently managed and accurately recorded.
- Oversee the processing of [Code of Conduct reports and escalations][coc-reports], upholding the CF's ethical standards and integrity.

This role is pivotal for the orderly and fair functioning of the CFC. While crucial in guiding processes and meetings, the Chairperson does not possess additional decision-making power or authority in setting the CFC's strategic direction. Their focus is on ensuring that the Council's operations are conducted effectively and impartially.

## Extended Governance Committee (EGC)

Expanding beyond the CFC, the Extended Governance Committee (EGC) plays a vital role in encompassing broader representation and decision-making within the CF.

- **Composition:** The EGC includes every member of the CF Council and one nominated leader from each CF project.
- **Role:** The EGC is responsible for making key decisions that have a [significant impact on the CF and its projects](#voting).

This structure ensures a balanced representation, combining strategic oversight with project-specific insights.

An up-to-date list of Project Leads as members of the EGC will be maintained in the `egc` [CONTACTS.yaml][] attribute.

## Meetings, Procedures and Decision-Making

The CFC uses electronic and (where possible) asynchronous methods for meetings and decision-making, catering to our globally distributed membership. This facilitates inclusive participation and effective governance.

- **Regular Meetings**: Quarterly online meetings focusing on strategic and operational discussions.
- **Annual General Meeting (AGM)**: Reviews the annual report and sets future plans, held online.
- **Special General Meetings**: For specific purposes, conducted electronically.

### Agendas, Access, and Records

- **Agenda Setting:** Agendas are prepared in advance, incorporating items proposed by CFC members and the general membership.
- **Public Access:** Meetings are generally open to the public, except for confidential matters.
- **Meeting Minutes:** Minutes and summaries of key decisions and discussions are stored in a GitHub repository as per our [Record Keeping policy][records].

### Electronic Participation and Decision-Making

Efficient participation and decision-making are essential for geographically dispersed CFC members.

- **Remote Involvement:** Meetings are conducted through teleconferencing and video conferencing tools.
- **Decision Making Outside Meetings:** Decisions are made outside of formal meetings through written consent, adhering to the [decision-making process][consensus], with appropriate [notice][] and [record keeping][records].

### Quorum

- **Quorum for Synchronous Meetings**: Presence of a majority of CFC members constitutes a quorum.
- **Quorum for Asynchronous Decision-Making**: Participation of a majority of CFC members constitutes a quorum.

**Adjustments for Disqualifications**: If any member is disqualified from a particular matter (for example, abstention due to a conflict of interest), the quorum is adjusted to exclude them. Similarly, suspended members are not counted for quorum purposes.

### Voting

The CFC prioritizes and prefers using [consensus for decision-making][consensus]. Voting is a final part in that process, and is used primarily to resolve disagreement.

Most decisions can proceed with majority approval, but critical decisions require a supermajority to proceed.

- **Significant operational decisions**: Critical decisions impacting the foundation's operations must be approved by a supermajority (2/3rds) of all CFC members. This includes suspending or revoking membership for an individual or project, or changes to the Foundation's operations.

-**Policy, Bylaws or other significant structural changes:** Major policy changes and amendments to bylaws must be approved by a sumpermajority (2/3rds) of all EGC members. This includes decisions such as amending the foundation's Bylaws or Articles of Incorporation, significant alterations to the foundation's structure or operations, and changes that broadly impact member projects.

- **Overruling CFC Decisions:** In instances where the CFC makes a decision, a supermajority vote of the EGC, or a supermajority (2/3rds) of all CF members, can override the CFC's decision, ensuring a balance of power and representation within the foundation's governance structure.

## Committees and Delegation

The CFC may form committees with specific purposes that are authorized to make recommendations but not final decisions on significant matters. Committees may consist of CFC members and other community contributors. They must keep regular [records][] and report to the CFC.

Certain critical actions (anything requiring a Supermajority vote) are reserved for the full CFC. Temporary or ad-hoc groups may be established for specific tasks, with the CFC retaining ultimate oversight and decision-making authority.
