## Meetings, Participation, and Record Keeping

### Regular and Special Meetings

- **Meeting Frequency:** The CFC holds regular meetings at least once per quarter to discuss strategic and operational matters.
- **Annual General Meeting (AGM):** An AGM reviews the annual report, financial status, and sets plans for the upcoming year.
- **Special General Meetings:** Convened for specific purposes, proposed by at least one-third of CFC members or a significant fraction of the general membership.
- **Place and Time:** Meetings can be held at any time and place as determined by the CFC, with a preference for online videoconference or teleconference.

### Electronic Participation and Action by Written Consent

- **Remote Involvement:** CFC members may participate in meetings electronically, including like teleconferencing or video conferencing.
- **Decision Making Outside Meetings:** The CFC can make decisions through written consent outside of formal meetings, involving a written resolution distributed to all CFC members for their approval or disapproval.
- **Effectiveness of Consent:** Actions by written consent are effective if they receive the majority's approval. This process is suitable for urgent or straightforward decisions not requiring a full meeting.

### Agendas, Access, and Records

- **Agenda Setting:** Agendas for meetings are prepared in advance, incorporating items proposed by CFC members and the general membership.
- **Public Access:** Meetings are generally open to the public, except for confidential matters.
- **Meeting Minutes:** Minutes or summaries of key decisions and discussions are stored in a GitHub repository as per our [Record Keeping policy][records].

## Composition and Membership

The CFC comprises elected members recognized for their contributions to the open-source community. As representatives of diverse organizations, CFC members are committed to prioritizing the interests of the CF community in their decision-making.

An up-to-date list of CFC members will be maintained in the `cf-council` [MEMBERS.yaml][] attribute.

**Structure:** The CFC is composed of a minimum of 3 elected members: 1 [CFC Chairperson](#cfc-chairperson) and at least 2 members-at-large. One-third of the CFC members must be direct representatives of CF projects to ensure a balanced representation of project needs and perspectives.

**Conflicts of Interest:** All members are required to adhere to the [Conflict of Interest Policy][coi-policy], and must disclose any potential conflicts of interest, especially those related to their employment. This commitment to transparency helps maintain the integrity of the CFC's decisions.

**Selection and Elections:** The selection process for CFC members is designed to reflect the diversity of the open-source community.

- Any member that has been active within the CF community for at least six months can run or be nominated.
- Every active CF member is entitled to one vote in annual [elections][].

### Tenure, Transition and Apportioning Duties

- **Staggered Elections:** To maintain continuity, no more than two-thirds of the CFC seats are up for re-election in each cycle.
- **Resignation:** CFC members wishing to resign must formally notify the Chairperson or the CFC, with immediate cessation of their responsibilities and rights as CFC members upon resignation.
- **Removal:** A CFC member may be removed for misconduct, failure to perform duties, or consistent non-participation. The removal process includes a fair review, an opportunity for the member to respond, and a decision made through a vote by the remaining CFC members or a general membership vote.
- **Vacancies:** In the event of a vacancy, duties are temporarily assigned to remaining members until a special election can be held to fill the vacated seat.
- **Apportioning Duties:** The CFC must ensure that all required [CFC Offices](#cfc-offices) are filled. 

### CFC Chairperson

The Chairperson orchestrates regular CFC meetings, ensuring leadership in discussions is evenly spread. They also oversee the proper handling of [Code of Conduct reports and escalations][coc-reports].

### CFC Offices

- **The Secretary:** This role may be filled by one or more members, sharing the responsibilities of maintaining records, overseeing official correspondence, and managing organizational documentation. The flexible approach to this role allows for the distribution of workload according to members' capacities and ensures continuity in administrative functions.

- **The Treasurer:** A pivotal role that must be filled by a dedicated member, the Treasurer is in charge of overseeing the financial affairs of the Foundation. This includes budgeting, financial reporting, and coordinating with Fiscal Hosts or Agents for accounting and financial management. The specificity of this role underscores its critical nature in maintaining the financial health and compliance of the Foundation.

The CFC may establish other roles as needed to ensure the smooth functioning of the Foundation. 

- **Officers and Staff:** The CFC may appoint CF general members as officers or hire staff to manage specific administrative functions. These officers and staff are not considered CFC members and do not have voting rights. 
  - Officers may be invited to attend CFC meetings as non-voting participants
  - Officers may resign at any time by notice to the CFC.

## Meeting Procedures and Decision-Making

### Quorum for Meetings

- **Quorum Requirement:** A quorum at any CFC meeting requires attendance by a majority of the total number of CFC members to ensure decisions are made with adequate participation and representation.
- **Adjournment in Absence of Quorum:** If a quorum is not present at a meeting, a majority of the CFC members present may adjourn the meeting until a quorum is achieved.
- **Reduced Quorum for Disqualified Members:** If any CFC member is disqualified from voting on a particular matter, the quorum required for that matter is reduced accordingly. Suspended CFC members (if any) are also not counted for the purposes of quorum.

### Decision-Making Process

- **Consensus-Based Approach:** The CFC strives to make decisions based on consensus, adhering to the Lazy Consensus model outlined in [General Decision Making][consensus]. This approach emphasizes collective agreement and accommodates diverse viewpoints.
- **Voting as a Last Resort:** If a consensus cannot be reached, the CFC resorts to voting. Decisions are then made by a simple majority of the voting CFC members present unless a supermajority is required.
- **Supermajority Requirement:** Certain critical decisions require a supermajority vote. A supermajority is defined as at least two-thirds of the total number of CFC members.

### Matters Requiring Supermajority Vote

The following matters must be approved by a supermajority vote of the CFC:

- Amending the Bylaws or Articles of Incorporation.
- Approving mergers, consolidations, or dissolution of the Foundation.
- Changing the size or eligibility requirements of the CFC.
- Major changes to the Foundation's structure or operations.
- Suspending or revoking membership for an individual or project.
- Any changes to the definition or rights of membership.
- Other significant decisions as determined by the CFC.

## Committees and Delegation

The CFC may form committees with specific purposes that are authorized to make recommendations but not final decisions on significant matters. Committees may consist of CFC members and and other community contributors. They must keep regular [records][] and report to the CFC.

Certain critical actions (anything requiring a Supermajority vote) are reserved for the full CFC. Temporary or ad-hoc groups may be established for specific tasks, with the CFC retaining ultimate oversight and decision-making authority.
