# CF Council and Offices

It describes the structure, responsibilities, and processes for the CF Council (CFC) and other offices.

The Commonhaus Foundation Council (CFC), as referenced in this document, fulfills the role and responsibilities of the Board of Directors as per the legal requirements of the State of Florida and as defined in our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws. The CFC is entrusted with the overall strategic guidance, governance, and fiduciary oversight of the Commonhaus Foundation.

CFC members must adhere to our [Conflict of Interest Policy][coi-policy] to ensure that personal or professional interests do not unduly influence their duties within the CF.

The CFC convenes regularly and holds an Annual General Meeting to review the annual report, financial status, and set future plans.
Special general meetings may be initiated with a defined agenda if proposed by at least a third of the CFC members or by a significant fraction of the general members.

Agendas and schedules for these gatherings will be released in advance.
Meetings open to the broader public are accessible to all members and interested observers.
Summaries of key decisions and discussions will be shared with the community to ensure that all members are informed and can provide feedback.

- **Concerns and Actions**: Members can voice concerns or propose actions by emailing `council@mailing-list` (TODO: or initiating a GitHub discussion, etc.).

## Composition and Membership

The CFC is composed of elected members who are recognized for their individual contributions and expertise in the open-source community. While members may be affiliated with various organizations, they are expected to prioritize the interests of the CF community in their decisions and actions.

CFC members are required to disclose any potential conflicts of interest, especially those related to their employment. This disclosure ensures transparency and helps maintain the integrity of CFC decisions.

The selection process for CFC members aims to reflect the diversity and breadth of the open-source community. We strive for a balanced representation that brings together a wide range of perspectives and skills.

- The CFC has a minimum of 3 elected members: 1 [CFC Chairperson](#cfc-chairperson) and at least 2 members-at-large.
- One-third of CFC members must be direct representatives from our projects, maintaining a strong voice for project needs and perspectives.
- **Eligibility**: Any member that has been active within the CF community for at least six months can run or be nominated.
- **Elections**: Conducted annually, with every member entitled to one vote.

An up-to-date list of CFC members will be maintained in the `cf-council` [MEMBERS.yaml][] attribute.

## Tenure and Transition

For continuity and stability, elections for CFC members (including the CFC Chair) are staggered.
In each election cycle, no more than two-thirds of CFC seats will be up for reelection.
Upon completing their tenure, CFC members may seek re-election to extend their service, or step down.

### Resignation and Removal of CFC Members

- CFC members wishing to resign must formally notify the Chairperson or the CFC, with immediate cessation of their responsibilities and rights as CFC members upon resignation.
- A CFC member may be removed for misconduct, failure to perform duties, or consistent non-participation.
  The removal process includes a fair review, an opportunity for the member to respond, and a decision made through a vote by the remaining CFC members or a general membership vote.

In the event of a vacancy, the CFC will temporarily assign the duties of the vacated position to other members. A special election will then be held to fill the vacant seat.

## Apportioning Duties Among CFC Members

The CFC will decide the distribution of specific roles and responsibilities, such as Secretary and Treasurer duties, among its members. This ensures effective governance and leverages the strengths and interests of each CFC member.

- The **Secretary** is responsible for maintaining records, overseeing official correspondence, and managing organizational documentation.
- The **Treasurer** oversees the financial affairs of the Foundation, including budgeting and financial reporting. In cases where a Fiscal Host or Agent is used, the Treasurer will coordinate with them for accounting and financial management.

### CFC Chairperson

The Chairperson orchestrates regular CFC meetings, ensuring leadership in discussions is evenly spread. They also oversee the proper handling of [Code of Conduct reports and escalations][coc-reports].

### Committees and Delegation

The CFC may establish committees to manage specific areas of responsibility. While delegating tasks to these committees, the CFC retains ultimate oversight and decision-making authority.
