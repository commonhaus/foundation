> üìù Note: This repo is a draft to explore an idea. It tries to be reasonably thorough to convey the concept, but there are lots of holes and details to sort through, and none of it has undergone any kind of legal review. [Discussions](https://github.com/commonhaus/foundation-draft/discussions) are open and input is welcome!

# The Commonhaus Foundation

Inspired by the legacy of [The Codehaus][codehaus], the Commonhaus Foundation (CF) is a collaborative environment‚Äîa shared space where innovation thrives, and where projects remain the center. Our aim is to provide a neutral home where longevity, security, and innovation converge, with non-interference being our guiding principle.

## Goals

**Content Creation**: Celebrate and champion the development of innovative tools, libraries, and frameworks, enabling the community to build pioneering solutions.

**Ecosystem Health**: Support projects where they need it most. Prioritize security, longevity, and accessibility, ensuring that projects‚Äîwhether big or small‚Äîget the resources they require.

**Open Source Assurance**: A promise to the community: all code under our banner will remain open source, ensuring its consistent and long-term availability in trusted repositories like Maven Central.

**Project Autonomy**: As a cornerstone of our foundation, all projects maintain their freedom and independence. We're here to provide resources, not directives.

## Unique Characteristics

**Preservation of Project Identity**: Projects retain and celebrate their individuality. While trademarks and domain names are donated, they stand distinct, allowing the world to recognize your contribution.

**Simplified Governance with Core Principles**: 

- **Transparency**: Your governance model remains yours. All we request is clarity in how your project is run. As part of our commitment to fostering a diverse and inclusive ecosystem, we champion [cooperative governance][governance] which encourages shared decision-making and collaborative leadership.

- **[Succession Planning][succession]**: We require administrative rights to ensure projects remain available to the community in the absence of original stewards, reaffirming our commitment to long-term sustainability.

**Empowerment Over Enforceability**: Our mission is to be a foundation that uplifts each project without restrictive barriers.

## Focus of the Commonhaus Foundation

**Action Over Deliberation:** We prioritize doing over discussing. Our emphasis:

- **Application Frameworks**: Streamlined app development and deployment.
- **Libraries**: Tools that simplify application complexities.

However, not everything aligns with our vision:

- **Specifications & Standards**: While crucial, we don't define or debate them.
- **Discussion-Centric Groups & Peripheral API Projects**: We're dedicated to being a home for code-driven projects.

## Community Affiliation

**No Pay-to-Play**: Participation remains free, allowing for genuine collaboration.

**Volunteer Board**: Comprising community leaders, longstanding library owners, and application framework pioneers.

**Licensing:** We stay true to open-source principles as defined by the OSI.

### Sponsorship Dynamics:

For sponsors, simplicity is key:

- **Direct Project Support**: Contributions go directly to aiding project maintainers, ensuring maximum impact.

- **Foundation Support**: By sponsoring the foundation, companies bolster our collective ability to support member projects, like Maven Central, without the hassle of navigating multiple channels.

Companies gain visibility and recognition for their support, showcasing their commitment to open-source innovation.
