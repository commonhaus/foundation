# The Commonhaus Foundation (CF)

The Commonhaus Foundation champions open-source innovation and collaboration.

We are dedicated to ensuring the long-term growth and stability of GitHub-style open-source projects through community collaboration and shared stewardship. Our mission is to empower a diverse community of contributors to create, maintain, enhance, and secure vital open-source libraries and frameworks.

Our vision is to create a dynamic and inclusive community where developers, contributors, and users unite to drive the evolution of open-source libraries and frameworks. We aim to cultivate an ecosystem that thrives on collaborative innovation, bypassing the complexities of traditional governance models.

## Core Distinctions of CF

Drawing inspiration from [The Codehaus][codehaus], CF offers the right balance of support without overwhelming governance.

**Minimal Viable Governance:** CF embraces the "community-first" model prevalent in modern GitHub-style projects.
While we provide foundational support, projects maintain their autonomy.

**Access to Funding:** We bridge the post-Kickstarter gap.
CF aids projects in meeting governance requirements, paving the way for them to access platforms like GitHub Sponsors or fiscal hosts such as Open Source Collective.

**Future-ready Flexibility:** CF acknowledges the evolutionary nature of projects.
We're not just a placeholder but a guide, assisting projects as they grow and, if needed, transition to foundations with more rigorous governance.

**Tailored for Established Projects:** CF is an ideal home for projects that already have a user base and are now seeking stability and growth without heavy governance overhead.

## Our Guiding Principles

**Do No Harm:** At our core, we believe in uplifting and supporting projects, not imposing restrictive constraints.

**Preserve Project Identity:** Even as trademarks and domain names integrate with CF, projects retain their distinct identity, celebrated and recognized globally.

**Transparency and Longevity:** We value clear governance and are committed to the sustainability of projects, evident in aspects like our [Succession Planning][succession].

**Empower, Don't Enforce:** CF's mission centers on empowerment without ensnaring projects in restrictive barriers.

## CF's Focus and Vision

**Prioritize Action:** We favor tangible outcomes over extended discussions, concentrating on:
- **Application Frameworks:** For efficient app development and deployment.
- **Libraries:** Essential tools that minimize application complexities.

**Selective Alignment:** Not every project aligns with CF. While we respect the importance of *Specifications & Standards*, we do not engage in their definition or debate. This is a home for self-governing, code-centric projects.

## Community and Sponsorship

CF is committed to inclusive growth, opening its doors to all individuals who share our vision, not just code contributors. We encourage participation from those interested in supporting and steering our projects, offering them a voice and a vote in our governance. For detailed information on membership and eligibility, refer to our [Governance](GOVERNANCE.md) document.

**Collaboration and Voice**: Our community thrives on cooperation and diverse perspectives. Here, every member, including project leaders and supporters, has the opportunity to contribute to decision-making processes.

**Advisory Input**: While sponsors do not have voting rights, they play a vital role through the [Advisory Board](GOVERNANCE.md#commonhaus-foundation-advisory-board), offering strategic insights that guide the foundation's direction. This structure ensures that sponsorship is aligned with community interests and open-source integrity.
