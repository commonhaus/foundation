> 📝 Note: This repo is a draft to explore an idea. It tries to be reasonably thorough to convey the concept, but there are lots of holes and details to sort through, and none of it has undergone any kind of legal review. [Discussions](https://github.com/commonhaus/foundation-draft/discussions) are open and input is welcome!

# The Commonhaus Foundation (CF)

**Mission Statement:**

"To support the long-term growth and stability of self-governed open-source projects in a GitHub-style environment."

**Vision Statement:**

"To establish a vibrant hub for developers, contributors, and users dedicated to fostering the growth of libraries and application frameworks without the overhead of traditional governance models."

## Core Distinctions of CF

**Minimal Viable Governance:** CF embraces the "community-first" model prevalent in modern GitHub-style projects. While we provide foundational support, projects maintain their autonomy.

**Access to Funding:** We bridge the post-Kickstarter gap. CF aids projects in meeting governance requirements, paving the way for them to access platforms like GitHub Sponsors or fiscal hosts such as Open Source Collective.

**Future-ready Flexibility:** CF acknowledges the evolutionary nature of projects. We're not just a placeholder but a guide, assisting projects as they grow and, if needed, transition to foundations with more rigorous governance.

**Tailored for Established Projects:** CF is an ideal home for projects that already have a user base and are now seeking stability and growth without heavy governance overhead.

## Our Guiding Principles

**Do No Harm:** At our core, we believe in uplifting and supporting projects, not imposing restrictive constraints.

**Preserve Project Identity:** Even as trademarks and domain names integrate with CF, projects retain their distinct identity, celebrated and recognized globally.

**Transparency and Longevity:** We value clear governance and are committed to the sustainability of projects, evident in aspects like our [Succession Planning][succession].

**Empower, Don't Enforce:** CF's mission centers on empowerment without ensnaring projects in restrictive barriers.

## CF's Focus and Vision

- **Prioritize Action:** We favor tangible outcomes over extended discussions, concentrating on:
  - **Application Frameworks:** For efficient app development and deployment.
  - **Libraries:** Essential tools that minimize application complexities.
- **Selective Alignment:** Not every project aligns with CF. While we respect the importance of *Specifications & Standards*, we do not engage in their definition or debate. This is a home for self-governing, code-centric projects.

## Community and Sponsorship

- **Genuine Collaboration:** This is a cooperative organization. Sponsors may advise, but will not have a vote.
- **By the Community:** Our volunteer board consists of seasoned community leaders, library owners, and innovators.
- **Open-Source Integrity:** We adhere to open-source principles as stipulated by the OSI.

For sponsors, we prioritize:

- **Direct Project Support:** Contributions can directly benefit project maintainers.

- **Holistic Foundation Support:** Sponsoring CF as a whole enhances our ability to assist all member projects and the surrounding ecosystem.

In sponsoring, companies demonstrate their commitment to open-source innovation, gaining both visibility and community appreciation.
