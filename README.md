# The Commonhaus Foundation (CF)

The Commonhaus Foundation champions open-source innovation, focusing on the long-term growth and stability of GitHub-style open-source projects. By fostering a dynamic and inclusive community, we empower contributors to drive the evolution of vital open-source libraries and frameworks through collaborative innovation.

## What sets Commonhaus apart

Inspired by the [The Codehaus][codehaus], CF offers a balanced approach to governance and support, designed for the unique needs of established open-source projects.

- **Stable, long-term home**: CF acknowledges the evolving nature of projects. By providing a neutral home, we offer an anchor supporting growth over time. We're committed to ensuring smooth transitions and fostering long-term resilience with thoughtful succession planning.

- **Minimum viable governance**: Adhering to a *community-first* model, CF offers foundational support that respects project autonomy, ensuring governance is effective without being restrictive.

- **Streamlined access to funding**: As a fiscal host with connections to platforms like GitHub Sponsors and OpenCollective, CF simplifies the process of securing funding, providing your project with the resources it needs for sustainability and growth.

## Core Focus and Vision

CF's action-oriented approach prioritizes **Application Frameworks** and **Libraries** that are critical for developers. We support self-governing, code-centric projects, steering clear of specifications and standards debates to focus on tangible outcomes.

## Community and Sponsorship

CF's doors are open to everyone passionate about open-source innovation. We invite all individuals, not just code contributors, to participate and help steer our projects. Our [Bylaws][] detail membership and governance, emphasizing collaboration, diverse perspectives, and advisory input from our [Advisory Board][cfab] to align sponsorship with community interests.
