The Commonhaus Foundation (CF) champions open source innovation, focusing on the long-term growth and stability of  community-driven open source projects.
We empower contributors to drive the evolution of vital open source libraries and frameworks through collaborative innovation.

## What sets Commonhaus apart

Inspired by the [The Codehaus][codehaus], CF offers a balanced approach to governance and support, designed for the unique needs of established open source projects.

- **Stable, long-term home**: CF acknowledges the evolving nature of projects. By providing a neutral home, we offer an anchor supporting growth over time. We're committed to ensuring smooth transitions and fostering long-term resilience with thoughtful succession planning.

- **Minimum viable governance**: Adhering to a *community-first* model, CF offers foundational support that respects project autonomy, ensuring governance is effective without being restrictive.

- **Streamlined access to funding**: As a fiscal host with connections to platforms like GitHub Sponsors and Open Collective, CF simplifies the process of securing funding, providing your project with the resources it needs for sustainability and growth.

## Our mission, vision and focus

We want to empower a diverse community of developers, contributors, and users to create, maintain, and evolve open source libraries and frameworks, ensuring long-term growth and stability through shared stewardship and community collaboration.

We envision a welcoming ecosystem where open source projects grow through collaboration and mutual support, simplifying participation for all by moving beyond conventional governance hurdles.

We prioritize **Application Frameworks** and **Libraries** that are critical for developers. We support self-governing, code-centric projects, steering clear of specifications and standards debates to focus on tangible outcomes.

## Community and sponsorship

Our doors are open to everyone passionate about open source innovation. We invite all individuals, not just code contributors, to participate and help shape our organization. Our [Bylaws][] detail membership and governance, emphasizing collaboration, diverse perspectives, and advisory input from our [Advisory Board][cfab] to align sponsorship with community interests.
