The Commonhaus Foundation (CF) champions open source innovation, focusing on the long-term growth and stability of  community-driven open source projects.
We empower contributors to drive the evolution of vital open source libraries and frameworks through collaborative innovation.

## What sets Commonhaus apart

Inspired by the [The Codehaus][codehaus], CF offers a balanced approach to governance and support, designed for the unique needs of established open source projects.

- **Stable, long-term home**: CF acknowledges the evolving nature of projects. By providing a neutral home, we offer an anchor supporting growth over time. We're committed to ensuring smooth transitions and fostering long-term resilience with thoughtful succession planning.

- **Minimum viable governance**: Adhering to a *community-first* model, CF offers foundational support that respects project autonomy, ensuring governance is effective without being restrictive.

- **Streamlined access to funding**: As a fiscal host with connections to platforms like GitHub Sponsors and OpenCollective, CF simplifies the process of securing funding, providing your project with the resources it needs for sustainability and growth.

## Our mission, vision and focus

We want to empower a diverse community of developers, contributors, and users to create, maintain, and evolve open source libraries and frameworks, ensuring long-term growth and stability through shared stewardship and community collaboration.

We envision a welcoming ecosystem where open source projects grow through collaboration and mutual support, simplifying participation for all by moving beyond conventional governance hurdles.

We prioritize **Application Frameworks** and **Libraries** that are critical for developers. We support self-governing, code-centric projects, steering clear of specifications and standards debates to focus on tangible outcomes.

## Community and sponsorship

Our doors are open to everyone passionate about open source innovation. We invite all individuals, not just code contributors, to participate and help shape our organization. Our [Bylaws][] detail membership and governance, emphasizing collaboration, diverse perspectives, and advisory input from our [Advisory Board][cfab] to align sponsorship with community interests.
