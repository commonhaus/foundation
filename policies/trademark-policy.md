# Commonhaus Foundation Trademark Policy

This document provides guidelines for the use of the Commonhaus Foundation's (CF) trademarks, ensuring they are used in a manner that promotes our open-source projects while maintaining their integrity and value.

Our trademarks, including the Commonhaus Foundation name, logo, and any project names, represent the quality and reliability our community has come to expect. This policy aims to balance the need for community engagement with the protection of our trademarks. If you have any questions or need further clarification, please [contact us](#contact-and-further-information).

## Covered Trademarks

This policy applies to all trademarks and service marks owned by the Commonhaus Foundation (collectively referred to as the “Marks”), including but not limited to:

- **Word Marks:** "Commonhaus Foundation" and any names of projects under our umbrella.
- **Logos:** The official Commonhaus Foundation logo and logos of individual projects.
- **Trade Dress:** The distinctive visual appearance of our website, product packaging, or promotional materials.

Some Marks may not be registered, but registration does not equal ownership of trademarks.

A list of registered trademarks, service marks, pending registrations, and marks in use can be found at <https://www.commonhaus.org/trademarks/>. Please note, this list is subject to change; we recommend checking back regularly for the most current information.

## Trademark Usage Guidelines

The Commonhaus Foundation encourages community use of its Marks to promote our projects, adhering to guidelines that prevent confusion and protect our reputation.
Unauthorized or misleading use of CF Marks, or use of marks confusingly similar to CF Marks, is prohibited and may infringe on trademark rights.

This policy supports flexible use of Marks while protecting against misuse. For situations not covered or if unsure about using the Marks, [contact us](#contact-and-further-information) for guidance.

## Guidelines for Commonhaus Trademarks

The use of Commonhaus Foundation (CF) Marks is governed by the following detailed guidelines. These are designed to ensure clarity, prevent misuse, and maintain the integrity of the Marks.

### Acknowledgment and Symbols

- Use the CF Marks in a form that distinguishes them from the text around them, such as by capitalization, bold or italic fonts, or with quotation marks.

- Use the appropriate symbol (® for registered trademarks; ™ for unregistered; ℠ for unregistered service marks) next to the first use of CF Marks. For a detailed list, visit [Commonhaus Trademarks](https://www.commonhaus.org/trademarks/).

- Use the full form of any trademarks (e.g., Commonhaus Foundation”) in the first reference in all documents of mass communication, including marketing collateral and web pages. You may then use any abbreviated or short form references (e.g. CF) within the same document where the full form has already been used.

### Compatibility and Interoperability

You may use the Word Marks, but not the Logos, to truthfully describe the relationship between your software and ours. The use of the Mark cannot be used to imply that the Commonhaus Foundation or its projects are sponsoring or endorsing your product.

Examples of proper and improper usage of Marks:

- Correct: &lt;your product name> for &lt;CF Mark>
- Correct: &lt;your product/company name> plug-in for &lt;CF Mark>
- Correct: &lt;your product name> compatible with &lt;CF Mark>
- Correct: &lt;your product name> for use with &lt;CF Mark>
- Correct: Quick Start for &lt;CF Mark> by &lt;your company name>
- Incorrect: &lt;CF Mark> &lt;your product name>
- Incorrect: &lt;CF Mark> by &lt;your company name>
- Incorrect: &lt;CF Mark> - &lt;your product name>
- Incorrect: &lt;your product/company name> - &lt;CF Mark>
- Incorrect: &lt;CF Mark> Quick Start by &lt;your company name>

### Proper Use of CF Marks

- Use a CF Mark as an Adjective Followed by the Generic Name/Noun. A trademark is neither a noun nor a verb.
    - Correct: [CF Mark] tools help ...
    - Incorrect: [CF Mark] your product ...

- Do Not Use a CF Mark in the Plural or Possessive Form, and Never Hyphenate or abbreviate. An exception to this can be when CF is used to refer to the Foundation‘s name.
    - Correct: Unique capability of the [CF Mark]™ development tools ...
    - Incorrect: [CF Mark]'s unique properties ...
    - Correct: [CF Mark]‘s technical conferences are held ...

- Do Not Use CF Marks that are not listed, or use Forms of CF Marks that vary from the list. Even a seemingly innocuous deviation may create a new and different trademark.
    - Do not shorten, abbreviate or create acronyms out of GNOME Trademarks.
    - A trademark that is depicted as or more words should never be compressed into one word or vise versa.
    - Check the list of CF Marks at <https://www.commonhaus.org/trademarks/> to verify exactly how the marks should appear.

- Do not use CF Marks (Logos or Word Marks) in any commercial or marketing context other than as expressly permitted in this policy unless you have obtained explicit written permission from the Commonhaus Foundation to do so.

- Do not use the Commonhaus Foundation trademarks more prominently than your own company, product or service name.

- Do not refer to a product or service as being certified under any CF Mark unless your company has explicit authorization to use such terms from the Commonhaus Foundation.

- Do not attempt to claim or assert any ownership rights in any mark of the Commonhaus Foundation and do not attempt to register any Commonhaus Foundation trademark as a trademark, trade name, domain name, or “doing business as” name, alone or (unless specifically licensed) in combination with your own trademarks.

- Do not use a logo of the Commonhaus Foundation on posters, brochures, signs, websites, crowdfunding sites, or other marketing materials to promote your events, products or services without written permission from the Commonhaus Foundation.

### Use in Community Engagement

Marks may be used to discuss and reference CF projects provided the use does not imply CF endorsement and is consistent with the preservation of the goodwill and value of the Mark.

- Do not use the CF Marks in a manner that would disparage the Commonhaus Foundation or its projects (e.g., untruthful advertising, false/misleading promotional materials, etc.).

- You may use the Word Marks in books and article titles, and the Logo in illustrations within a document, as long as the use does not suggest that we have published, endorse, or agree with your work.

- Do not use CF Logos on the cover of a book or magazine without written permission.

- You may use CF Marks for private and personal use to make t-shirts, stickers, and caps for yourself and your friends (meaning people from whom you don’t receive anything of value in return).

- You may use a CF Mark as a link to the home page of the applicable project or to a CF web site that is relevant to the reference.

### Visual Identity

Use only official versions of the Logo obtained from the Commonhaus Foundation or its projects.

You may not change any Logo except to scale it. This means you may not add decorative elements, change the colors, change the proportions, distort it, add elements, or combine it with other logos.

When the context requires the use of black-and-white graphics and the logo is color, you may reproduce the logo in a manner that produces a black-and-white image.
