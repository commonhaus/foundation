# Commonhaus Foundation Anti-Trust Policy

## Purpose

The Commonhaus Foundation (CF) requires that all members, activities, projects, committees, and working groups comply with applicable anti-trust laws.

## Scope

This policy applies to all participants in Commonhaus Foundation activities, including but not limited to general members, project representatives, councilors, and contributors to CF projects. It is designed to complement the [Conflict of Interest Policy](./conflict-of-interest.md) and other governance documents of the foundation.

## Commitment to Compliance

By participating in official or informal CF activities, participants commit to upholding this policy and promoting fair competition.

## General Principles

1. **Compliance with laws**: All members and participants in CF activities must comply with all applicable anti-trust and competition laws.
2. **Fair competition**: Individuals participating in CF activities must not engage in practices that unfairly limit competition, such as price-fixing, market allocation, or bid-rigging.
3. **Avoiding anti-competitive practices**: Participants in CF activities must avoid discussions or agreements that could be seen as anti-competitive, including:
    - Pricing strategies or policies
    - Division of markets or customers
    - Boycotts of specific vendors, customers, or products
    - Limiting production or restricting supply

## Guidelines for Meetings and Communications

1. **Agendas and anti-trust questions**: All meetings should follow a prepared agenda as described in the [bylaws](../bylaws/3-cf-council. Potential anti-trust questions posed by the agenda should be raised in advance.
2. **Reporting concerns**: If at any time a member believes that a discussion or activity may violate anti-trust laws, they should immediately report their concerns to the CF Council or legal advisor.

## Participation in Foundation activities

1. **Open participation**: The foundation encourages open participation in its projects and activities. Membership in CF should not be used to exclude or disadvantage any individual or entity.
2. **Intellectual property**: Members should adhere to the [Intellectual Property Policy](./ip-policy.md), ensuring that participation in CF projects does not restrict competition or the free use of technologies.
3. **Governance practices**: Project representatives must ensure that the governance practices used by their projects adhere to this anti-trust policy.

## Handling Violations

Any reported or suspected violations of this policy will be promptly investigated by the CF Council.

## Consequences of Violations

Antitrust law violations can lead to severe consequences, including heavy fines for both companies and individuals, imprisonment in some jurisdictions, civil claims for damages by affected parties, and reputational damage to members and the CF.

Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary action, including suspension or revocation of membership.

## Review and Updates

This policy will be reviewed periodically to ensure it remains effective and relevant. Amendments will be made in accordance with the CFâ€™s governance processes.

## Acknowledgment

All members are required to acknowledge their understanding and acceptance of this policy upon joining CF and at regular intervals as determined by the CF Council.
