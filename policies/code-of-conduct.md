## Our Code of Conduct

The CF is dedicated to creating a welcoming and inclusive environment. Our Code of Conduct (CoC), derived from the [Contributor Covenant v1.4](#contributor-covenant-code-of-conduct), sets the standard for behavior within our community.

Leadership across the CF, including [Councilors][cfc] and project representatives, are [expected](#leadership-expectations) to respect and uphold this CoC to foster an environment of respect and collaboration.
The [Code of Conduct Panel (CoCP)](#code-of-conduct-panel) provides an avenue for appeals or escalations, if necessary.

New projects are expected to adopt this CoC within three months of joining.

### Member Expectations

We expect all members and contributors to engage constructively, respecting diverse viewpoints as a vital aspect of our collaborative environment. Key expectations include:

- **Direct Engagement**: Strive for direct resolution of disagreements. Disagreement can play an important role in fostering innovation, but only when the resolution process remains constructive.
- **Respect and Consideration**: Treat every community member with respect, focusing on ideas rather than individuals.
- **Active Listening and Learning**: Embrace different perspectives, aiming to learn from othersâ€™ experiences and viewpoints.
- **Anti-Trolling**: Avoid behavior that intentionally disrupts discussions. Trolling[^1] undermines constructive dialogue and will not be tolerated.
- **Commitment to Diversity**: Explore resources on diversity, inclusion, and unconscious bias to contribute to an environment where everyone feels welcome.

If you're interested in an introduction to diversity, inclusion, and unconscious bias, consider these resources:

#### Leadership Expectations

Leaders should act with respect, engage directly, and be willing to resolve conflicts. See [Martha's Rules][] and the [Decision Making][] section of our bylaws for examples of how to help constructively resolve disagreement.

CF Leadership is also responsible for ensuring that decisions, once made, are supported and revisited only when necessary to uphold the integrity of the collaborative process.

[Decision Making]: ../bylaws/5-decision-making.md

### Report an issue

Disagreements and conflicts are inherent to any dynamic community. We encourage direct dialogue as the first step toward resolution, recognizing that constructive disagreement can lead to innovation and growth.

For issues that escalate beyond direct resolution or involve behavior contrary to our Code of Conduct, the CF provides clear avenues for reporting:

- **Project-Specific Reporting**: Each CF project may implement its own CoC enforcement processes suitable to its size and scope. These processes and contact methods should be detailed in the project's `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.
- **Foundation-Wide Reporting**: For concerns not covered by a specific project's `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, or for issues that require escalation beyond the project level, reports should be directed to the [report mailing list][CONTACTS.yaml]. The CFC will oversee these reports.

Our commitment extends beyond rule enforcement to fostering an environment where every member feels supported, valued, and able to contribute to positive outcomes from conflicts.

### Confidentiality and Safety

Confidentiality is paramount in handling reports.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.
The CF strictly prohibits retaliation against anyone who reports concerns in good faith.
Our procedures are designed to ensure that everyone in our community can work in a safe and respectful environment.

There may be circumstances where sharing personal information becomes necessary.
We may share personal information where explicit permission has been given, when required by law, or when a report raises significant safety concerns.

Given that membership to groups like the CFC or the CoCP have finite terms, members reviewing CoC reports agree to treat all reports as confidential, even after their term is finished.

### Respond to a CoC issue

The CF is dedicated to a fair and prompt review of all reports. Each report initiates a process of review and, where necessary, investigation. The focus is on understanding the context, assessing the situation, and determining an appropriate course of action in line with our commitment to our community's safety and integrity.

In evolving our system for managing confidential reports, we aim to ensure transparency, accountability, and the protection of all community members. Further details on the process will be made available as they are developed, ensuring they align with our foundational principles and legal obligations.

### Escalate an issue

We expect most reports to be handled by the processes put in place by a project or the CFC.

The CF maintains the CoCP to manage escalation when a reporter (a) believes that a report to a member project or the CFC has not been properly handled, or (b) does not feel comfortable reporting an issue through the standard process.

To escalate an issue to the CoCP, send an email to the [`coc-escalation` mailing list][CONTACTS.yaml]. The CoCP will meet to review submitted reports as described in [CF CoC procedures](#reports-to-the-coc-report-mailing-list).

### Code of Conduct Panel

The CoCP is a foundation-wide team composed of the CFC Chairperson and 4 elected individuals who are not Councilors.

CoCP members serve for two year terms. CF contributors and members from the broader community can be nominated to the CoCP.
CF members should consider objectivity and diversity of experience and perspective when electing CoCP members.

Members of the CoCP will be documented in the `cocp-panel` [CONTACTS.yaml][] attribute.

## Handling Reports and Escalations

This section describes the process and roles for handling Code of Conduct (CoC) reports and escalations for both the CFC and the CF Code of Conduct Panel (CoCP).

### Conflict of Interest

Any member of the CFC or CoCP who is involved in the report must recuse themselves from the discussions.

### Reports to the CoC report mailing list

All Councilors are subscribed to the [`report` mailing list][CONTACTS.yaml].

We understand that the person reporting the issue (**reporter**) may not be the individual directly affected or harmed (**target**). In such cases, communication will primarily be with the reporter unless the target explicitly gives permission.

1. **Acknowledgement:** Upon receipt of a report, a Councilor acknowledges it, confirming receipt to the reporter or target.
2. **Point of Contact:** If no response has been sent by the next CFC meeting, the Chairperson will ensure a Councilor is designated as the primary point of contact.
3. **Information Gathering:** All relevant information is collected and centralized for review.
4. **Discussion:** The gathered information is discussed to contextualize the facts and opinions.
5. **Determination:** A consensus is reached on the appropriate response using the standard [CFC decision-making process][cc-dm].
6. **Communication of Resolution:** The resolution is shared with the reporter or target. Feedback loops can continue until concerns have been adequately addressed. Absence of feedback within 7 days means resolution acceptance.
7. **Finalization:** The agreed resolution is implemented.

### Reports to the CoC Escalation mailing list

All members of the CoCP are subscribed to the [`coc-escalation` mailing list][CONTACTS.yaml].

The CoCP will follow the same overall procedure as the CFC, with the following changes:

- **Point of Contact:** The CFC Chairperson will ensure a member of the CoCP is identified as the main point of contact either through email or scheduling a meeting for the CoCP.
- **Communication of Resolution:** When an appropriate response has been determined by the CoCP, the proposed action is discussed with leaders of the relevant group (the CFC or the CF project). If the leadership representatives expresses concerns then the contact person will bring these back to the CoCP members for further discussion. This cycle can continue until the CoCP members reach consensus that the leadership representatives concerns have been adequately addressed.

# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when
an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces.
Examples of representing a project or community include using an official
project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting
as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of
a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at [INSERT EMAIL ADDRESS]. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
