# Security Vulnerability Reporting for Commonhaus Foundation Projects

## Reporting a Vulnerability:

1. **Do Not Disclose Publicly**: If you believe you've found a security vulnerability in a CF project, please do not post it in public places such as public issue trackers, mailing lists, or forums.

2. **Send Directly to Project Maintainers**: Send all the pertinent details to the project maintainers directly. If they have a dedicated security email, use that. If not, contact the primary maintainers.
  - [GitHub: Report security vulnerabilities privately](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)
  - [GitLab: Use confidential issues](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/confidential_issues.html)

3. **Use Encryption**: For an added layer of security, consider encrypting your message using the maintainer's PGP key if available.

4. **Provide Details**: Clearly describe the nature and potential impact of the vulnerability. If possible, include steps to reproduce or proof of concept.

## What Happens Next?

1. **Acknowledgment**: Once we receive your report, the project team will acknowledge it, usually within 48 hours.

2. **Assessment and Mitigation**: The vulnerability will be analyzed, and necessary patches or mitigations will be implemented.

3. **Credit**: We respect the importance of security researchers. When the vulnerability is disclosed, we'll ensure you get proper credit unless you wish to remain anonymous.

## Public Disclosure Timing:

1. **Coordinated Disclosure**: The timing of the public disclosure will be agreed upon with the reporter. Typically, it's done after a patch or mitigation strategy has been devised and shared with affected users.

2. **Regular Updates**: The team will keep the reporter updated about the progress and expected disclosure timeline.

## General Guidelines:

1. **Act in Good Faith**: This community is built on trust. Please act responsibly, avoid data destruction, service disruption, and privacy violation when researching vulnerabilities.

2. **Feedback**: We're always open to feedback on this policy. If you have suggestions for improvement, feel free to share them.
