# Commonhaus Foundation Intellectual Property Policy

This document outlines our policies on intellectual property (IP) to guide contributors and safeguard the interests of our projects and community.

## License Selection and Usage

CF projects can use any [open-source license approved by the Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/licenses/) (OSI). The CF is most familiar with the following four licenses, which can simplify the review process:

- [The Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)
- [The MIT License][MIT]
- [The 2-Clause BSD License](https://opensource.org/license/bsd-2-clause/)
- [The 3-Clause BSD License](https://opensource.org/license/bsd-3-clause/)

Selection of other OSI-approved licenses is permitted but may require additional review by the [Commonhaus Foundation Council][cfc] (CFC).

## Contributions

Code contributions should comply with the project's chosen license.

Contributions are validated through a [Developer Certificate of Origin][DCO] (DCO) or a Contributor License Agreement (CLA), as determined by the project.

### Documentation and Media Files

Projects should choose an appropriate license for documentation and media files, such as [CC BY 4.0][] or the project's primary license.

All contributions must be clearly labeled with license information.

## Collaborations and External Projects

When collaborating with external open-source projects ("Upstream Projects"):

- Comply with the Upstream Project's licensing requirements.
- Prioritize compatibility
- Seek alternative license approvals from the CFC when necessary.

## Intellectual Property Rights

CF membership does not grant or transfer intellectual property rights unless explicitly stated by this policy or a Project's license.

## Implementing the IP Policy

Project leaders should ensure compliance with this policy and provide clear guidance to contributors.

- Use the [standard website footer][] for member project websites,
- Ensure that contribution guidelines are updated and accessible, and
- (optionally) Maintain accurate copyright statements.

### Copyright Statements

Using [copyright statements in your code][code-copyright] is a practice with mixed adoption.

If your project wants to add copyrights to source code, we recommend one of the following:

- Copyright &lt;year of file creation> The XYZ Authors.
- Copyright &lt;year of file creation> Contributors to the XYZ project.
- Copyright &lt;year of file creation> The original author or authors.

Updating the year after the file is created is unnecessary.

Do not alter existing copyright lines unless you have the right to do so.

## Obtaining an Exemption

If the [IP Policy][] doesn't cater to your project's needs, request special permission from the CFC.

[Steps to request an exemption TBD]

## Review of Policy

This policy will be reviewed periodically to ensure it remains relevant and effective. Amendments or changes to this policy will follow the [amendment process][].
