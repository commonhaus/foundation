# Dissolution and Asset Distribution

In the unfortunate event that the Commonhaus Foundation must dissolve, the following steps will be taken to ensure a responsible and lawful closure:

- **Settling Liabilities:** First, we will pay off any outstanding debts or obligations the Foundation has incurred.
- **Asset Distribution:** After clearing all liabilities, any remaining assets will be distributed to one or more organizations that share a similar mission or goals as the CF. This could include other nonprofit groups, like those classified under Section 501(c)(3) (charitable organizations) or other 501(c)(6) organizations (business leagues or chambers of commerce).
- **Compliance with Tax Laws:** We will ensure that this asset distribution complies with the requirements of Section 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code, or the corresponding section of any future federal tax code.
- **Court Involvement if Necessary:** If there are any assets left after this and no suitable organization is identified for their transfer, we will work with a competent court in the area where the CFâ€™s main office is located. The court will then decide which organization(s) aligned with our mission and goals should receive the remaining assets.

This plan for dissolution ensures that the CF's assets will be used in a manner consistent with its mission and purpose, even after the organization ceases to exist.

## Procedures for Dissolution

- **Decision to Dissolve:** The decision to dissolve the CF must be approved by a supermajority vote of the CF Council (CFC).
- **Notification:** Upon the decision to dissolve, members, stakeholders, and relevant authorities must be notified.
- **Asset Distribution:** Assets will be allocated in accordance with the dissolution clause and any legal requirements.
- **Finalization:** All final legal steps required to complete the dissolution will be taken, including filing necessary documents with the appropriate authorities.
