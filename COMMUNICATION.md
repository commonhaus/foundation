## Contribute a Project

Are you looking for a long-term home for your open source project? We are here to support its growth and sustainability.

If you maintain a project that could be a good fit for the Commonhaus Foundation, [create a discussion](https://github.com/commonhaus/foundation/discussions/categories/joining-commonhaus) and let us know more about it.

We are currently finalizing our formal application and acceptance process, but we are excited to start the conversation. We are especially interested in active, mature open source projects.

**How to Contribute Your Project:**

1. **Start a Discussion**: Begin by [starting a discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/commonhaus/foundation/discussions/categories/joining-commonhaus). This allows us to understand your project and how it aligns with our mission.
2. **Fill Out the Template**: Our discussion template will guide you through providing the necessary details about your project.
3. **Initial Review**: Once the discussion is started, our team will review your submission and reach out for further discussions if needed.
4. **Acceptance and Onboarding**: After a successful review, we will discuss the onboarding process, including the steps to integrate your project into our community and the support we offer to ensure its success.

We look forward to learning more about your project and how we can work together to support your project over the long haul.
