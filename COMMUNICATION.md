## Contribute a Project

Looking for a long-term home for your open-source project?
Commonhaus may be the right place.

The application process is still taking shape as we bootstrap the foundation, but applications are open.
We are especially interested in active, mature open source projects at this time.

If you think your project could be a good fit, we encourage you to apply.

**How to Apply:**

1. **Start a Discussion**: Create a [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/commonhaus/foundation/discussions/categories/joining-commonhaus) to share details about your project and how it aligns with the foundation’s mission.
2. **Fill Out the Template**: Our discussion template will guide you through providing the necessary details.
3. **Initial Review**: Once the discussion is started, our team will review your submission and reach out for further discussions if needed.
4. **Acceptance and Onboarding**: After a successful review, we’ll discuss the onboarding process and the steps needed to integrate your project into our community.

Every project brings something unique to the Commonhaus ecosystem.
We look forward to learning more about yours!
