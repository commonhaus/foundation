# Commonhaus Foundation Project Governance

The Commonhaus Foundation (CF) is a nonprofit membership organization dedicated to open-source innovation and collaboration.

Organizational governance is described in detail in the [Bylaws][bylaws], which are the authoritative source for all policies and procedures. What follows is a quick reference to the key governance concepts and processes.

## CF Council

The **CF Council (CFC)** is the governing body responsible for overarching decisions, financial allocations, and setting future plans. It consists of elected members who prioritize the interests of the CF community in their actions.

- **Concerns and Actions**: Members can voice concerns or propose actions by emailing the [`council` mailing list][CONTACTS.yaml] (TODO: or initiating a GitHub discussion, etc.).

See [CF Council][cfc] for more details.

## CF Membership and Roles

- **Projects**: Open-source projects that are donated to CF. Project Leaders submit an application for their project to join the Commonhaus Foundation.
- **Project Leaders and Code Owners**: Key contributors who drive CF projects. They hold admin and/or write permissions in project repositories. Project leaders are CF members and are eligible for election to the CFC.
- **General Members**: CF Membership is open to all who support our mission. Active members, contributing in various ways, can gain voting rights and participate in elections.

See [Membership and Roles][membership] for more details.

## CF Advisory Board

The **CF Advisory Board** comprises representatives from supporting organizations. They offer strategic guidance to the CFC.

See [CF Advisory Board (bylaws)][cfab] for more details.

## Decision Making and Voting

CF uses the Lazy Consensus decision-making model. When seeking consensus, members should express objections or dissent as early as possible to ensure there is time to discuss and address objections. See [Decision making (bylaws)][cf-decision-making] for more details.

For CFC elections, CF adopts a preference-based voting system facilitated by [Elekto](https://elekto.dev/).

Every member, regardless of their role or contribution level, has an equal voice and is entitled to one vote in all decisions.

## Record Keeping

The CF is committed to maintaining thorough and accessible records of its activities as documented in [Record Keeping][records].

## Code of Conduct

All participants in the project are expected to adhere to the project's [Code of Conduct][coc]. Please ensure you are familiar with its guidelines and expectations, as it's essential for maintaining a positive and collaborative environment.
