# The Commonhaus Foundation Project Governance

The Commonhaus Foundation is a collaborative space where contributors come together. 
While working in groups can present challenges, this document lays out the guidelines that foster unity and progress.

## Project Roles

**Members:** Anyone actively contributing to projects under the CF can apply to be a member. This includes code contributors, documentation writers, designers, and others. Members have the right to vote in Council elections and raise concerns related to the project.

**Code Owners:** These are experienced members who oversee specific areas of the project. They review contributions, guide direction, and ensure quality.
- Access: They have write permissions to the repository.
- Reference: Managed through the repository's `CODEOWNERS` file.

## Commonhaus Foundation Council

The Commonhaus Foundation Council (CFC) is the governing body of the CF, responsible for overseeing financial allocations, ensuring fiscal responsibilities are met, and setting future plans that serve the collective interests of the community.

The Council convenes regularly and holds an Annual General Meeting (AGM) to review the annual report, financial status, and set future plans. Special general meetings may be initiated with a defined agenda if proposed by at least a third of the Council members or by a significant fraction of the general members. 

Agendas and schedules for these gatherings will be released in advance. Meetings open to the broader public are accessible to all members and interested observers.

## Composition and Membership

The Council has a minimum of 3 elected members: 1 [Council Chairperson](#chairperson-of-the-council) and at least 2 members-at-large. 

- **Eligibility**: Any member can run or be nominated.
- **Elections**: Conducted annually, with every member entitled to one vote.
- **Diversity**: To avoid undue influence, no single company or legal entity can hold more than one seat on the Council.
- **Concerns and Actions**: Members can voice concerns or propose actions by emailing `council@mailing-list` (TODO: or initiating a GitHub discussion, etc.).

### Tenure and Transition

For continuity and stability, elections for Council members (including the Council Chair) are staggered. 
In each election cycle, no more than two-thirds of Council seats will be up for reelection. 

Upon completing their tenure, CFC members may:

- Seek re-election to extend their service.
- Endorse another nominee, fostering new participation.
- Opt to step aside, making space for fresh voices on the Council.

Such an approach introduces fresh perspectives yet preserves institutional knowledge, ensuring the Council's consistent effectiveness in decision-making and setting the direction for the CF.

#### Chairperson of the Council

The Chairperson orchestrates regular CFC meetings, ensuring leadership in discussions is evenly spread. They also oversee the proper handling of [Code of Conduct reports and escalations][coc-reports].

## Decision Making and Voting

True to Open Source roots, the CF ensures every member's voice is heard through the Lazy Consensus decision-making model.

 To quote the [Consensus definition](https://community.apache.org/committers/decisionMaking.html) from the Apache Foundation: 

> Consensus
>
> The word ‚Äúconsensus‚Äù is a bit ambiguous in English, and so can lead to some misunderstandings of intent when we use it in the context of project decisions. Consensus does not mean that everyone agrees on all details. Rather, it means that the project, as a whole, has arrived a decision, or at least a compromise, that everyone can live with.
>
> Lazy Consensus
>
> Lazy consensus is the first, and possibly the most important, consensus-building tool we have. Essentially lazy consensus means that you don‚Äôt need to get explicit approval to proceed, but you need to be prepared to listen if someone objects.

When seeking consensus, members should express objections or dissent as early as possible to ensure there is time to discuss and address objections.

Every member, regardless of their role or contribution level, has an equal voice and is entitled to one vote in all decisions.

### Seeking consensus in meetings

When an agenda item has appeared to reach a consensus the moderator will ask "Does anyone object?" as a final call for dissent from the consensus.

If an agenda item cannot reach a consensus a CFC member can call for either a closing vote or a vote to table the issue to the next meeting.
The call for a vote must be seconded by a majority of the CFC or else the discussion will continue.

For all votes, a simple majority of all Voting CFC members for, or against, the issue wins.
A Voting CFC member may choose to participate in any vote through abstention.

### Seeking consensus on mailing lists

When seeking consensus in mailing lists, it is important to leave enough time (at least 72-hours) for everyone to read the email and respond with opinions and objections.

CFC members should consider the following when drafting consensus-seeking email:
  - Use a leading indicator (`[DISCUSS]` or an emoji like üó≥Ô∏è) to mark consensus-seeking email
  - Use a clear subject line that summarizes the topic
  - If there is a time constraint to the decision, include it in the subject.

It is customary for the initiator to post a summary once it appears that consensus has been reached, to ensure that their understanding is accurate.
